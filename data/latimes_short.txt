NEW FALLOUT FROM CHERNOBYL;

<P>
THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF THE CHERNOBYL DISASTER BY DAVID R. MARPLES (ST. MARTIN'S 
PRESS: $35, CLOTH; $14.95, PAPER; 316 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-312-02432-0)

By James E. Oberg , Oberg, a space engineer in Houston, is the author of 
Uncovering Soviet Disasters: Exploring the Limits of Glasnost (Random House).

<TEXT>
<P>
The onset of the new Gorbachev policy of glasnost, commonly mistranslated as 
openness but closer in connotation to candor or publicizing, has complicated 
the task of Soviet secret-keepers and has allowed substantial new Western 
insights into Soviet society. David R. Marples' new book, his second on the 
Chernobyl accident of April 26, 1986, is a shining example of the best type of 
non-Soviet analysis into topics that only recently were absolutely taboo in 
Moscow official circles. 
</P>
<P>
The author, a British-educated historian and economist, is a research associate 
with the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies at the University of Alberta, 
and the academic style of the book is undisguised. However, its intended 
audience is the general public, and anyone interested in nuclear power, or 
Soviet economy and society, or human drama, or just plain sleuthing state 
secrets, will find hitherto unpublished revelations and explanations of the 
event and its continuing aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
The effects of Chernobyl reverberated throughout so many facets of Soviet 
society that a continuous coherent narrative is probably impossible. Marples 
discusses half a dozen major themes arranged in a fairly arbitrary order (as 
indicated by the frequent and helpful cross references throughout the text) and 
succeeds in mapping out his main themes. The personal interests of each reader 
determine which of the sections may be deemed too detailed and which too 
sketchy, but considering the need for such a comprehensive overview, the levels 
are generally appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
The book is, on the one hand, not a light read, and an executive summary might 
have been possible in a quarter the length. But, on the other, so many of the 
judgments depend on a subtle interpretation of a multitude of sources that the 
author is obligated to present the raw data for the reader's inspection. The 
modular nature of the book also allows a reader to skip, browse, and revisit 
earlier sections, aided by a convenient internal organization and a thorough 
index. 
</P>
<P>
First in the world's attention, and in the text, is a discussion of the human 
victims of the accident. The official tally is 31 (only about 20 names have 
ever been released), but Marples suspects there were other short-term radiation 
victims. A large number of unnecessary late-term abortions were also performed 
on local women, and by rights those unborn babies count as casualties. 
Widespread "radiophobia" led to restricted diets which created malnourishment 
and subsequent disease in thousands of people. The tens of thousands of people 
taking part in cleanup operations were never included in official totals of 
those exposed. Since the book went to press, Soviet military sources have 
referred to at least one death in the actual reactor entombment program. 
</P>
<P>
But the greatest toll is likely to occur with the delayed deaths. Here, Marples 
encounters for the first time the soon familiar theme of official Soviet 
myth-making around the event: Reality is twisted to serve state policy 
objectives, which include calming an alarmed public with assurances that all is 
well when it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
And thus is born what he properly labels the "myth of Chernobyl," the official 
line that the disaster provided a test that Soviet society passed with honor. 
"In the Soviet view," he writes, "it was first and foremost a victory, a story 
with an ending, and an ending that was triumphant." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when sober Western medical estimates placed the future "excess cancer 
deaths" at several tens of thousands, both in the Soviet Union and in Europe (a 
few tenths of a percent elevation of the natural cancer rate), the Soviets 
reacted furiously. The estimates are branded "nonsense" and the estimators are 
dismissed as "panic mongers" promulgating "anti-Soviet venom." 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently the author addresses themes of environmental impact, economic and 
political repercussions, public images, and the recovery operations. Along the 
way, Marples provides a damning list of examples in which Soviet officials 
attempted to retreat behind old-style cover-ups and outright lies. False 
information was issued on radiation levels, on subsequent accidents at the 
site, on contamination levels of the Kiev water supply, on severe discipline 
against non-volunteer cleanup personnel, on reactor entombment schedules and on 
operator training levels. 
</P>
<P>
A severe 1986-1987 countrywide electrical power shortage was officially denied 
although it was real enough to compel the restart of three Chernobyl reactors 
in explicit violation of Soviet safety regulations. Design deficiencies of the 
Chernobyl-style reactors were downplayed and human errors were declared to be 
the primary culprit. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, observes the author, "It is ironic that in an era of openness, 
Chernobyl may have been both the pioneer of glasnost under Gorbachev and then 
subsequently its first casualty." He ultimately concludes, "Aspects of the 
disaster . . . have rarely been dealt with thoroughly or even honestly by 
Soviet sources." Hence the need for this book, a need which is admirably 
fulfilled despite the many remaining mysteries and uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
The July, 1987, trial of reactor personnel marked a full circle of disclosure. 
Journalists were allowed into the pre-scripted first and last days, but the 
weeklong deliberative sessions were held in secret and no word of their 
substance has ever been released. 
</P>
<P>
The propaganda purpose of the trial and surrounding official publicity, he 
maintains, had one goal: "To divert culpability from the party hierarchy, in 
Kiev and especially in Moscow." This is precisely the theme I have also 
encountered in my own investigations of aerospace accidents of the past. Where 
individual human failings led to catastrophe, a sanitized story may eventually 
be released, but where Kremlin policy led to disaster (such as the Nedelin 
catastrophe of 1960 or the Soyuz-1 disaster in 1967), the entire event remains 
absolutely off limits to glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
The closing blow-by-blow description of the nuclear power debate presages a 
dramatic event which occurred too recently for inclusion in this first edition. 
Viktor Legasov, tagged by the author as one of the country's two leading 
pro-nuclear advocates, actually was sinking into private despair over the poor 
implementation of safety standards. In the end, he made his final and most 
eloquent testimony to this despair on the second anniversary of the accident, 
by committing suicide. For several weeks the Soviets tried to sit on the 
circumstances of his "tragic death," even issuing official non-explanations 
which asserted that the death was not due to medical effects of radiation. 
Finally, crusading journalist Vladimir Gubarev, with access to Legasov's 
notebooks, broke the story in Pravda. Readers of this book will come to know 
these and other characters so well that the suicide fits right into the "big 
picture" of the catastrophe's social impacts. 
</P>
<P>
For an author to so accurately describe a social milieu that subsequent 
unpredictable events only enhance his insights is testimony to the highest 
quality of scholarship. Readers of Marples' book will rarely be surprised as 
the Chernobyl catastrophe's consequences continue to unfold in the future.

TOCQUEVILLE A BIOGRAPHY BY ANDRE JARDIN; TRANSLATED BY LYDIA DAVIS WITH ROBERT 
HEMENWAY(FARRAR, STRAUS &amp; GIROUX: $30; 548 PP.)

By Annette J. Smith and David R. Smith , Both Smiths are professors at Caltech 
and co-translators and editors of 'Mademoiselle Irnois' and Other Stories by 
Arthur de Gobineau (University of California Press), who was, among other 
things, Tocqueville's secretary.

<TEXT>
<P>
Andre Jardin's "Tocqueville," surprisingly the first full-scale biography of 
this major 19th-Century figure, is a fine, old-fashioned piece of work, some of 
it original, much of it taken from the ample precedent scholarship. It provides 
an abundant store of information and an occasional surprise -- a dozen years 
after its publication, we find the author of "Democracy in America," now 
minister of foreign affairs, exclaiming: "But what animals these Americans 
are!" 
</P>
<P>
It is as the author of "Democracy in America" that Tocqueville is known in this 
country; but what this biography reveals is not so much an admirer of America 
as a Frenchman of his time, circumstance and needs, even when he is in America. 
He came here with his friend Beaumont ostensibly as a student of penitentiary 
reform, but Tocqueville really wanted to take a larger look at this new 
republic, since it was clear to him that the European drift was in that 
direction, and what intrigued him was its democratic base, since he had been 
brought up to believe that a republic could function only when run by a 
virtuous elite. We know what he found and how he responded, but the biography 
also reveals, almost inadvertently, why he was such an accurate and 
comparatively unbiased observer. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, he had not biased himself by reading contemporary travel 
literature, much of it written by snide Tories pretending to take an 
unprejudiced look at the American experiment. Capt. Basil Hall's infamous 
"Travels" had been only partially translated (the chapter on prison reform) 
into French, and, in any event, it was his companion Beaumont who read it. The 
result was that Tocqueville's vision had not been prejudiced (other than by his 
relative Chateaubriand's romance with New World nature). For another, 
Tocqueville and Beaumont readied themselves each day by preparing questions for 
the people they would meet, questions based upon their own observations sur 
place and designed to elicit responses useful to them as Frenchmen trying to 
prepare themselves for a possible future. They were not, as were the Tories, 
justifying a past. 
</P>
<P>
Tocqueville's Cartesian clarity, his relative lack of bias, meant that he used 
the answers to his questions to form a useful statement about America, but the 
questions themselves and their reasons reveal perhaps even more about France. 
By looking at this intelligent, open-minded, and inquiring young civil servant 
and nobleman of impeccable political parentage (great grandson of Malesherbes), 
Jardin's book provides the American reader a marvelous introduction to the 
political shiftings, the gradual yet sometimes violent post-revolutionary 
cracking of the political structure in France as it grappled simultaneously 
with the shattered legitimacy of the past, a slippery present and an 
ill-defined future. 
</P>
<P>
After the immediate success of "Democracy in America" (1835), Tocqueville 
entered the political arena and was elected deputy for the arrondissement of 
Valognes, the region of his family castle in Normandy. He sat left of center in 
the Chamber. Although many at the time thought of him as an Carlist aristocrat 
and some in this country think of him as an American-style conservative, 
Tocqueville considered the old aristocracy "dead for ever." Over the years, he 
demonstrated his liberalism by fighting for parliamentary monarchy, separation 
of church and state, reform of the suffrage laws, improvement of the worker's 
lot, for liberalizing public education, abolishing slavery wherever it existed, 
improving the prison system and eliminating poverty. He managed, nevertheless, 
to stay clear of several more powerful champions of liberal causes such as 
Lamartine, Royer-Collard, and Thiers, who would have liked to have him on their 
side but whose egos he mistrusted. 
</P>
<P>
Independence is what most characterizes Tocqueville's career. A colleague 
reproached him for "giving the right hand to the left, the left to the right 
and regretting that he does not have a third one to give invisibly." "Freedom 
is the strongest of my passions. Voila. It is the truth," he explained to 
disconcerted observers. If he moved left, it was, he claimed, to impose his 
color on the left, not change his own. 
</P>
<P>
Another constant was his hatred of centralization. In "L'Ancien Regime et la 
Revolution," Tocqueville analyzed the roots of centralization in France, which 
according to him went as far back as the reign of Philip the Fair in the Middle 
Ages. He lamented the fact that centralization had destroyed time-tested local 
organic structures and that the French nobility itself was at fault in the 
process. Tocqueville fought centralism in all of its manifestations as he saw 
them. For instance, rather an agnostic himself, he defended religious education 
because he believed in the healthy necessity of a third force besides the state 
and the people. 
</P>
<P>
Tocqueville's anticentralism colored his responses to the various colonial 
enterprises that characterize European history of the period. Thus, in newly 
conquered Algeria, he favored a kind of settlement based on local autonomy 
rather than central metropolitan power. He was the first man in the Chamber to 
push for a separate ministry for Algeria -- a dream that became a fact only a 
century later in Leon Blum's cabinet. He deplored the downfall of the Ottoman 
Empire in the Middle East, since the Turks were not only a desirable bumper 
between the major European predators, but also relatively tolerant themselves 
toward the diversity of their possessions. He admired the respect for local 
customs that the British had shown in India. 
</P>
<P>
Tocqueville was an active, intelligent legislator, esteemed particularly for 
his work on penitentiary reform (inspired by the Philadelphia system) and on 
the abolition of slavery, but he was not a sensational figurehead. One might 
say that, like Montaigne, he had lived through a great deal of political 
turmoil and managed to preserve an independent judgment. When Louis-Napoleon 
was propelled into the presidency at the end of the bloody 1848 revolution, 
Tocqueville was given the foreign affairs ministry in the Barrot cabinet. He 
served with the same unsensational distinction as in the Chamber but was fired 
after only five months. He had protested Louis-Napoleon's coup d'etat that made 
an emperor of the president and was briefly imprisoned in Vincennes -- luckier 
in this than one of our great-grandfathers, who was sent to the Sahara for the 
same offense. From then to his death from tuberculosis in Cannes in 1859, 
Tocqueville led the life of a gentleman farmer and journalist who, amid 
numerous changes of residence to accommodate his health, wrote (but did not 
finish) "L'Ancien Regime et la Revolution." 
</P>
<P>
This long and scrupulous study of a man who was one of the most profound and 
prophetic thinkers of his time, is, alas, scrupulous to the point of boredom. 
The narration rarely deviates from an inexhaustible concatenation of facts 
related in the soberest of prose. Although it does justice to Tocqueville's 
ideas, it fails in rendering the passion and the grace of his intellectual life 
and the social brilliance of the era. Moreover, the book is curiously 
organized: The order followed a mixture of the chronological and of the 
thematic, with several baffling leaps from one to the other. Andre Jardin's 
work constitutes an excellent work of reference for the scholar. It is indexed 
and substantially but not cumbersomely footnoted. Still it makes the layman 
yearn for the livelier manner of much recent historical writing.
