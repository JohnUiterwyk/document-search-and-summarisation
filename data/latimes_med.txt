NEW FALLOUT FROM CHERNOBYL;
</P>
<P>
THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF THE CHERNOBYL DISASTER BY DAVID R. MARPLES (ST. MARTIN'S
PRESS: $35, CLOTH; $14.95, PAPER; 316 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-312-02432-0)

<P>
By James E. Oberg , Oberg, a space engineer in Houston, is the author of
Uncovering Soviet Disasters: Exploring the Limits of Glasnost (Random House).
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The onset of the new Gorbachev policy of glasnost, commonly mistranslated as
openness but closer in connotation to candor or publicizing, has complicated
the task of Soviet secret-keepers and has allowed substantial new Western
insights into Soviet society. David R. Marples' new book, his second on the
Chernobyl accident of April 26, 1986, is a shining example of the best type of
non-Soviet analysis into topics that only recently were absolutely taboo in
Moscow official circles.
</P>
<P>
The author, a British-educated historian and economist, is a research associate
with the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies at the University of Alberta,
and the academic style of the book is undisguised. However, its intended
audience is the general public, and anyone interested in nuclear power, or
Soviet economy and society, or human drama, or just plain sleuthing state
secrets, will find hitherto unpublished revelations and explanations of the
event and its continuing aftermath.
</P>
<P>
The effects of Chernobyl reverberated throughout so many facets of Soviet
society that a continuous coherent narrative is probably impossible. Marples
discusses half a dozen major themes arranged in a fairly arbitrary order (as
indicated by the frequent and helpful cross references throughout the text) and
succeeds in mapping out his main themes. The personal interests of each reader
determine which of the sections may be deemed too detailed and which too
sketchy, but considering the need for such a comprehensive overview, the levels
are generally appropriate.
</P>
<P>
The book is, on the one hand, not a light read, and an executive summary might
have been possible in a quarter the length. But, on the other, so many of the
judgments depend on a subtle interpretation of a multitude of sources that the
author is obligated to present the raw data for the reader's inspection. The
modular nature of the book also allows a reader to skip, browse, and revisit
earlier sections, aided by a convenient internal organization and a thorough
index.
</P>
<P>
First in the world's attention, and in the text, is a discussion of the human
victims of the accident. The official tally is 31 (only about 20 names have
ever been released), but Marples suspects there were other short-term radiation
victims. A large number of unnecessary late-term abortions were also performed
on local women, and by rights those unborn babies count as casualties.
Widespread "radiophobia" led to restricted diets which created malnourishment
and subsequent disease in thousands of people. The tens of thousands of people
taking part in cleanup operations were never included in official totals of
those exposed. Since the book went to press, Soviet military sources have
referred to at least one death in the actual reactor entombment program.
</P>
<P>
But the greatest toll is likely to occur with the delayed deaths. Here, Marples
encounters for the first time the soon familiar theme of official Soviet
myth-making around the event: Reality is twisted to serve state policy
objectives, which include calming an alarmed public with assurances that all is
well when it isn't.
</P>
<P>
And thus is born what he properly labels the "myth of Chernobyl," the official
line that the disaster provided a test that Soviet society passed with honor.
"In the Soviet view," he writes, "it was first and foremost a victory, a story
with an ending, and an ending that was triumphant."
</P>
<P>
Thus, when sober Western medical estimates placed the future "excess cancer
deaths" at several tens of thousands, both in the Soviet Union and in Europe (a
few tenths of a percent elevation of the natural cancer rate), the Soviets
reacted furiously. The estimates are branded "nonsense" and the estimators are
dismissed as "panic mongers" promulgating "anti-Soviet venom."
</P>
<P>
Subsequently the author addresses themes of environmental impact, economic and
political repercussions, public images, and the recovery operations. Along the
way, Marples provides a damning list of examples in which Soviet officials
attempted to retreat behind old-style cover-ups and outright lies. False
information was issued on radiation levels, on subsequent accidents at the
site, on contamination levels of the Kiev water supply, on severe discipline
against non-volunteer cleanup personnel, on reactor entombment schedules and on
operator training levels.
</P>
<P>
A severe 1986-1987 countrywide electrical power shortage was officially denied
although it was real enough to compel the restart of three Chernobyl reactors
in explicit violation of Soviet safety regulations. Design deficiencies of the
Chernobyl-style reactors were downplayed and human errors were declared to be
the primary culprit.
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, observes the author, "It is ironic that in an era of openness,
Chernobyl may have been both the pioneer of glasnost under Gorbachev and then
subsequently its first casualty." He ultimately concludes, "Aspects of the
disaster . . . have rarely been dealt with thoroughly or even honestly by
Soviet sources." Hence the need for this book, a need which is admirably
fulfilled despite the many remaining mysteries and uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
The July, 1987, trial of reactor personnel marked a full circle of disclosure.
Journalists were allowed into the pre-scripted first and last days, but the
weeklong deliberative sessions were held in secret and no word of their
substance has ever been released.
</P>
<P>
The propaganda purpose of the trial and surrounding official publicity, he
maintains, had one goal: "To divert culpability from the party hierarchy, in
Kiev and especially in Moscow." This is precisely the theme I have also
encountered in my own investigations of aerospace accidents of the past. Where
individual human failings led to catastrophe, a sanitized story may eventually
be released, but where Kremlin policy led to disaster (such as the Nedelin
catastrophe of 1960 or the Soyuz-1 disaster in 1967), the entire event remains
absolutely off limits to glasnost.
</P>
<P>
The closing blow-by-blow description of the nuclear power debate presages a
dramatic event which occurred too recently for inclusion in this first edition.
Viktor Legasov, tagged by the author as one of the country's two leading
pro-nuclear advocates, actually was sinking into private despair over the poor
implementation of safety standards. In the end, he made his final and most
eloquent testimony to this despair on the second anniversary of the accident,
by committing suicide. For several weeks the Soviets tried to sit on the
circumstances of his "tragic death," even issuing official non-explanations
which asserted that the death was not due to medical effects of radiation.
Finally, crusading journalist Vladimir Gubarev, with access to Legasov's
notebooks, broke the story in Pravda. Readers of this book will come to know
these and other characters so well that the suicide fits right into the "big
picture" of the catastrophe's social impacts.
</P>
<P>
For an author to so accurately describe a social milieu that subsequent
unpredictable events only enhance his insights is testimony to the highest
quality of scholarship. Readers of Marples' book will rarely be surprised as
the Chernobyl catastrophe's consequences continue to unfold in the future.

THE ARISTOCRAT AS INDEPENDENT VOTER;
</P>
<P>
TOCQUEVILLE A BIOGRAPHY BY ANDRE JARDIN; TRANSLATED BY LYDIA DAVIS WITH ROBERT
HEMENWAY(FARRAR, STRAUS &amp; GIROUX: $30; 548 PP.)
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Annette J. Smith and David R. Smith , Both Smiths are professors at Caltech
and co-translators and editors of 'Mademoiselle Irnois' and Other Stories by
Arthur de Gobineau (University of California Press), who was, among other
things, Tocqueville's secretary.
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andre Jardin's "Tocqueville," surprisingly the first full-scale biography of
this major 19th-Century figure, is a fine, old-fashioned piece of work, some of
it original, much of it taken from the ample precedent scholarship. It provides
an abundant store of information and an occasional surprise -- a dozen years
after its publication, we find the author of "Democracy in America," now
minister of foreign affairs, exclaiming: "But what animals these Americans
are!"
</P>
<P>
It is as the author of "Democracy in America" that Tocqueville is known in this
country; but what this biography reveals is not so much an admirer of America
as a Frenchman of his time, circumstance and needs, even when he is in America.
He came here with his friend Beaumont ostensibly as a student of penitentiary
reform, but Tocqueville really wanted to take a larger look at this new
republic, since it was clear to him that the European drift was in that
direction, and what intrigued him was its democratic base, since he had been
brought up to believe that a republic could function only when run by a
virtuous elite. We know what he found and how he responded, but the biography
also reveals, almost inadvertently, why he was such an accurate and
comparatively unbiased observer.
</P>
<P>
For one thing, he had not biased himself by reading contemporary travel
literature, much of it written by snide Tories pretending to take an
unprejudiced look at the American experiment. Capt. Basil Hall's infamous
"Travels" had been only partially translated (the chapter on prison reform)
into French, and, in any event, it was his companion Beaumont who read it. The
result was that Tocqueville's vision had not been prejudiced (other than by his
relative Chateaubriand's romance with New World nature). For another,
Tocqueville and Beaumont readied themselves each day by preparing questions for
the people they would meet, questions based upon their own observations sur
place and designed to elicit responses useful to them as Frenchmen trying to
prepare themselves for a possible future. They were not, as were the Tories,
justifying a past.
</P>
<P>
Tocqueville's Cartesian clarity, his relative lack of bias, meant that he used
the answers to his questions to form a useful statement about America, but the
questions themselves and their reasons reveal perhaps even more about France.
By looking at this intelligent, open-minded, and inquiring young civil servant
and nobleman of impeccable political parentage (great grandson of Malesherbes),
Jardin's book provides the American reader a marvelous introduction to the
political shiftings, the gradual yet sometimes violent post-revolutionary
cracking of the political structure in France as it grappled simultaneously
with the shattered legitimacy of the past, a slippery present and an
ill-defined future.
</P>
<P>
After the immediate success of "Democracy in America" (1835), Tocqueville
entered the political arena and was elected deputy for the arrondissement of
Valognes, the region of his family castle in Normandy. He sat left of center in
the Chamber. Although many at the time thought of him as an Carlist aristocrat
and some in this country think of him as an American-style conservative,
Tocqueville considered the old aristocracy "dead for ever." Over the years, he
demonstrated his liberalism by fighting for parliamentary monarchy, separation
of church and state, reform of the suffrage laws, improvement of the worker's
lot, for liberalizing public education, abolishing slavery wherever it existed,
improving the prison system and eliminating poverty. He managed, nevertheless,
to stay clear of several more powerful champions of liberal causes such as
Lamartine, Royer-Collard, and Thiers, who would have liked to have him on their
side but whose egos he mistrusted.
</P>
<P>
Independence is what most characterizes Tocqueville's career. A colleague
reproached him for "giving the right hand to the left, the left to the right
and regretting that he does not have a third one to give invisibly." "Freedom
is the strongest of my passions. Voila. It is the truth," he explained to
disconcerted observers. If he moved left, it was, he claimed, to impose his
color on the left, not change his own.
</P>
<P>
Another constant was his hatred of centralization. In "L'Ancien Regime et la
Revolution," Tocqueville analyzed the roots of centralization in France, which
according to him went as far back as the reign of Philip the Fair in the Middle
Ages. He lamented the fact that centralization had destroyed time-tested local
organic structures and that the French nobility itself was at fault in the
process. Tocqueville fought centralism in all of its manifestations as he saw
them. For instance, rather an agnostic himself, he defended religious education
because he believed in the healthy necessity of a third force besides the state
and the people.
</P>
<P>
Tocqueville's anticentralism colored his responses to the various colonial
enterprises that characterize European history of the period. Thus, in newly
conquered Algeria, he favored a kind of settlement based on local autonomy
rather than central metropolitan power. He was the first man in the Chamber to
push for a separate ministry for Algeria -- a dream that became a fact only a
century later in Leon Blum's cabinet. He deplored the downfall of the Ottoman
Empire in the Middle East, since the Turks were not only a desirable bumper
between the major European predators, but also relatively tolerant themselves
toward the diversity of their possessions. He admired the respect for local
customs that the British had shown in India.
</P>
<P>
Tocqueville was an active, intelligent legislator, esteemed particularly for
his work on penitentiary reform (inspired by the Philadelphia system) and on
the abolition of slavery, but he was not a sensational figurehead. One might
say that, like Montaigne, he had lived through a great deal of political
turmoil and managed to preserve an independent judgment. When Louis-Napoleon
was propelled into the presidency at the end of the bloody 1848 revolution,
Tocqueville was given the foreign affairs ministry in the Barrot cabinet. He
served with the same unsensational distinction as in the Chamber but was fired
after only five months. He had protested Louis-Napoleon's coup d'etat that made
an emperor of the president and was briefly imprisoned in Vincennes -- luckier
in this than one of our great-grandfathers, who was sent to the Sahara for the
same offense. From then to his death from tuberculosis in Cannes in 1859,
Tocqueville led the life of a gentleman farmer and journalist who, amid
numerous changes of residence to accommodate his health, wrote (but did not
finish) "L'Ancien Regime et la Revolution."
</P>
<P>
This long and scrupulous study of a man who was one of the most profound and
prophetic thinkers of his time, is, alas, scrupulous to the point of boredom.
The narration rarely deviates from an inexhaustible concatenation of facts
related in the soberest of prose. Although it does justice to Tocqueville's
ideas, it fails in rendering the passion and the grace of his intellectual life
and the social brilliance of the era. Moreover, the book is curiously
organized: The order followed a mixture of the chronological and of the
thematic, with several baffling leaps from one to the other. Andre Jardin's
work constitutes an excellent work of reference for the scholar. It is indexed
and substantially but not cumbersomely footnoted. Still it makes the layman
yearn for the livelier manner of much recent historical writing.

TUNGSTEN A NOVEL BY CESAR VALLEJO; TRANSLATED BY ROBERT MEZEY; FOREWORD BY
KEVIN J. O'CONNOR (SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY PRESS: $19.95; 168 PP.; 0-8156-0226-X)

By Edith Grossman, Grossman is a critic and translator of Latin American
literature. She teaches at Dominican College in New York State, is the author
of The Antipoetry of Nicanor Parra and recently translated Gabriel Garcia
Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera.
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why read "Tungsten," a partisan novel written almost 60 years ago in which evil
is unmitigated, virtue unblemished, and the characters seem to lack dimension
or complexity as they play out their predetermined roles on the stage of the
class struggle? Why read a book in which ideology reigns supreme, and why
celebrate its first, belated translation into English? Because the author is
Cesar Vallejo, one of the great poets of the 20th Century and a major figure in
Latin American literature.
</P>
<P>
Vallejo created a wrenching poetic language for Spanish that radically altered
the shape of its imagery and the nature of its rhythms. No facile trend setter,
Vallejo forged a new discourse in order to express his own visceral compassion
for human suffering. He saw the world in piercing flashes of outrage and
anguish, terror and pity, and what he saw wounded him like knife thrusts. A
passionate, tragic poet, he mourned our loss of moral innocence and despaired
of the injustice that moves the world. In the late 1920s, when he was living in
Paris and eking out a meager livelihood as a journalist, the pain at the roots
of his being found objective substantiation in radical politics.
</P>
<P>
Born in the Peruvian Andes in 1892, he witnessed firsthand the victimization
and exploitation of the South American Indians. Although his own family was not
financially destitute (his father was a notary and minor bureaucrat in the
small town of Santiago de Chuco), Vallejo was a cholo, a person born of mixed
European and Indian ancestry. The fact is not irrelevant. In a society where
social and economic status followed the color line with cosmic certainty, where
racial discrimination was rigidly adhered to although rarely acknowledged in
public, the representatives of foreign companies, with the wholehearted
complicity of domestic colleagues, extracted high profits from the near-slavery
of the illiterate, utterly alienated and ultimately helpless victims of that
racism. Vallejo had ample opportunity to witness the brutalization en masse of
the Indian underclass and the appalling greed of their lighter-skinned masters
who carried on the colonial tradition of using Indians as forced labor in mines
and on plantations.
</P>
<P>
Twentieth-Century writers from Ciro Alegria to Manuel Scorza have denounced the
Peruvian tragedy in their books. "Tungsten" was one of the earliest novels to
do so in modern terms. As a young man, however, Vallejo's greatest energies
were devoted to writing and publishing his poems ("Los heraldos negros," his
first book, appeared in 1918); consequently, he remained on the periphery of
the windstorms of political and social unrest that swept through South America
in the second decade of the century, although he was in the time and place
where growing agitation to establish justice for Peruvian Indians and workers
began its inexorable march toward Marxism.
</P>
<P>
Vallejo, Jose Carlos Mariategui (the "Shining Path" in today's Peru takes its
name from his writings) and Victor Raul Haya de la Torre (a founder of the
important APRA movement -- the "Popular Revolutionary American Alliance")
crossed paths at the university in Trujillo. But Vallejo was an intermittent
student. His family began to experience economic difficulties during his
adolescence, and he was obliged to interrupt secondary school and then his
university studies to take a series of jobs, which included office work in the
mines at Tambores and Quiruvilca, and on a large sugar plantation in the
Chicama Valley.
</P>
<P>
These facts are not irrelevant either. They provided the historical raw
material for "Tungsten," the documented background to Vallejo's outcry against
the grim realities of Indian life in Peru. The shape that material would take
-- his conviction that the problem of race was indistinguishable from the
problem of class -- was determined by his increasingly active commitment to
socialism, a political engagement that, by 1930, led to his expulsion from
France, where he had gone to live seven years earlier.
</P>
<P>
The action of the novel is centered in a fictional mining town and its
provincial capital, Colca. The time is 1917, just before the U.S. entry into
World War I when a ready supply of tungsten would be crucial to the weapons
industry. A North American corporation takes over the mine, and the boom is on:
Peasants are first lured and then coerced into working for the company, local
Indians, the Soras, are cheated of their land and animals, petit bourgeois
entrepreneurs scramble on the backs of the poor for wealth and position, and
venal officials and dignitaries find a new source of bribery and
power-brokering in the foreign capitalists. The first two-thirds of the book,
in fact, constitutes a genre study of unashamed thuggery, a series of vignettes
of corruption, repression and brutality that sets the stage for the violent
heart of "Tungsten" and the appearance of its proletarian Indian hero, Servando
Huanca.
</P>
<P>
Two Indian boys are forcibly conscripted into military service (the military as
well as the mining contractors have "body quotas" -- numbers of recruits or
workers that must be obtained by any means), and on the long march from their
homes to Colca, when they are tied by the waist to the mules that their captors
ride, they are so badly abused that one of them eventually dies. Outside the
Subprefecture an angry crowd gathers, indignant at the visible signs of the
conscripts' mistreatment. One defiant man, Servando Huanca, steps forward to
speak for the crowd with natural authority and an instinctive class
consciousness. These qualities inspire the people and momentarily cow the
authorities, but then the troops are ordered to fire into the crowd, and later
that night officially sanctioned vigilantes pursue any Indian they can find,
shooting to kill. Some, however, are taken into custody, and deals are struck
by sleazy officials which allow the prisoners to be sent off to a sure death in
the mines to help fulfill the company's "body quota."
</P>
<P>
Last and certainly least, the third section of the book is a kind of postscript
to the Colca massacre. Vallejo allows his indignation and passion to turn into
mechanical ideology: Servando Huanca "duckspeaks" a mercifully brief exercise
in orthodoxy, proclaiming that world revolution is under way, that it will be
led by a militant proletariat inspired by Lenin and not by bourgeois
"intellectuals," that it will sweep away the ruling classes in Peru. Vallejo
even permits the novel to end with this ponderously symbolic sentence:
"Outside, the wind was rising, portending storm."
</P>
<P>
Kevin J. O'Connor has written a thoughtful and informative foreword, Robert
Mezey has done a fine job of translating Vallejo's often quirky Spanish, and
both of them deserve our gratitude for their sensitivity and skill in bringing
the work to the attention of an English-language audience. I am sorry that I
cannot say as much for the editing. The typographical errors are frequent and
unforgivable, and there is no indication as one reads that Mezey has provided
important end notes to the text. This is a disservice to the reader; Vallejo
and his translator deserve better.

EXTINCT IN THE LAND OF FIRE;

<P>
WHO WILL REMEMBER THE PEOPLE BY JEAN RASPAIL; TRANSLATED BY JEREMY LEGGATT
(MERCURY HOUSE: $18.95; 215 PP.)
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Schmitt , Schmitt is a professor of Latin American literature at CSU
Long Beach whose latest work is a translation of Chilean poet Raul Zurita's
Anteparadise (University of California Press).

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The four tribes of the now-extinct native Americans that once inhabited the
Tierra del Fuego archipelago -- that ships' graveyard along the land's end,
southern tip of South America -- were among the most primitive and hardy
peoples encountered in the New World. In this fine piece of historical fiction
cum-exemplary story, French novelist Jean Raspail explores the sad fate of the
Alacalufs (who called themselves Kaweskar, "The People"), the lesser known of
the two tribes of sea-nomads or "canoe Indians."
</P>
<P>
Raspail reconstructs the history of the Alacalufs through their own eyes and
those of Magellan, Drake and other historical figures. In this noble quest of
the "other" (those whose languages and customs seemed so alien to Europeans
that they refused to admit that they belonged to the human species), the view
from "within" is attempted through a synopsis of generations, of millennia, in
the mind of the character Lafko, a kind of collective memory of the Alacalufs.
The view from "without" reveals a shameful history of smug disdain: From
Magellan on, Europeans judged the Alacalufs to be "ugly," "stinking,"
"disgusting," "brutish," "beasts," "animals"; they kidnaped them, enslaved them
and, at worst, their genocidal instincts unleashed, they turned their guns and
cannons on them for sport, exterminated them; in the end, they were hunted for
bounty or herded into missionary stations where they died of white man's
diseases or the despair of captivity, and the last stragglers were reduced to
bartering and begging in the shipping lanes of the Strait of Magellan. The
complicity of scientists (like Darwin) in fostering this outcome is addressed
in a couple of the chapters.
</P>
<P>
The other side of the coin -- that our survival, too, depends on our ability to
embrace others not as a function of our own ideal but of theirs -- is seen in
the tragic fate of the inhabitants of Name of Jesus and the City of King
Philip, Spain's first settlement communities in Tierra del Fuego,who went mad
or starved to death. The English privateer Cavendish rechristened the latter
city Port Famine.
</P>
<P>
The point is brought home in the moving chapter, "A Civilized Gentleman." Sir
John Byron, shipwrecked in the Strait in his youth and rescued by the
Alacalufs, returns to the scene years later and ponders the legacy of European
contacts: "What an endless history of contempt is unraveled! And yet . . . ."
An instinct for survival had not saved his fellow castaways. He alone had
survived by crossing the cultural abyss and living with the Alacaluf clan for
six months, and the clan had braved the seas and their fears of the world
beyond their territory to set him down on an island from which Chilotan seal
hunters returned him to Puerto Montt.
</P>
<P>
But when Raspail attempts to give us a glimpse from within (the inner life of
the Alacalufs), the reader is aware of a European mind wedged between him and
the "other." The Alacalufs are "endlessly fleeing," "forsaken" pariahs,
"commanded by fate to survive, not to live" in a land shrouded in "an eternally
black sky," "a witches' dance of cruel winds," "a hell of snow and winds."
</P>
<P>
But this area is also stunningly beautiful, and Father Martin Gusinde has
compared the Yamana, a sister tribe, to 'fidgety birds of passage who were
happy and inwardly calm only when they were on the move'). In two recent works,
Bruce Chatwin ("The Songlines") and Mario Vargas Llosa ("El Hablador" ("The
Speaker") ) convincingly draw the reader into the soul-life, the Earth-bound
myths and legends of the Australian Bushmen and the Peruvian Machiguengas,
respectively. Raspail is far less successful in a parallel attempt with the
Alacalufs, and the fault is not in Jeremy Leggatt's translation, which is
excellent.
</P>
<P>
Despite that limitation, Raspail's story, inscribed in the dialogue of cultures
so characteristic of our age, is a fine version in historical fiction of a true
story loud with ethical reverberations. As First-World nations, we are
collectively responsible for the fate of colonized and subjugated peoples in
the Third World, but we have hardly begun to address those responsibilities.

ago, the youngest in the parade's history. Now, she's been invited back to be
grand marshal of the 100th Rose Parade, which starts Monday at 8 a.m. (to be
covered on various TV stations; see Watchables for details). She joins a select
group of others who have been grand marshals twice: Bob Hope, Richard Nixon and
Earl Warren.

FICTION IN BRIEF: ROCK ME

This novel's hip style, smooth tone and sensual spirit distinctively recall the
music of Steely Dan, a resemblance which turns out to be more than accidental,
for Marcelle Clements lives with Donald Fagen, Steely Dan's lead singer and
composer. Clements, a journalist, wrote "Rock Me" in part to evoke the lives of
the musicians she first met at New York City's High School of Music and Art and
then toured with in a yearlong stint as one of Fagen's backup singers. On this
level, "Rock Me" is absorbing and believable. Casey and Michael, Clements'
protagonists, are accurate portrayals of 1960s rockers grappling with the late
1980s. Up on shrinks, down on drugs (after years of riding high) and longing
for friendship though often sidetracked by lust, they speak in a delightfully
spacey dialect from somewhere in between the San Fernando Valley and the New
School for Social Research: "It's just been a horrible grind for so long,"
Casey tells Michael, "that now I have this, like, unbelievable negative tropism
about all of it."
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Clements' language, with no evidence of satire, strays from the
eccentric to the insipid. "You really have a great tan," Casey tells Michael.
"I hope so," he responds. "Because that's all I have." Clements' point of view
is also stylistically problematic, changing from first to third person for no
apparent reason. A final problem is Clements' attempt to study a love triangle.
Casey, the burnt-out lead singer in a highly successful band, leaves New York
City to recuperate in Hawaii. There, she meets Michael, her former lover and
band partner, and his girlfriend Leslie. Sensing the desire between Casey and
Michael, Leslie, hardly monogamous herself, sanctions an affair between the
two. Casey and Michael eventually make love, but rather than confronting her
feelings toward Michael, Casey abruptly returns to New York, riddled with guilt
over her "dirty deed."
</P>
<P>
Clements' portrait of Casey, nevertheless, is an intimate and credible sketch
of a neurotic artist. Casey returns to New York confused, but creatively
reinvigorated, concluding that she can only realize her fantasies in her music:
"The best affair is the affair you don't have . . . except in your songs."

MEMORIES OF A CHINESE-AMERICAN BOYHOOD;
</P>
<P>
THE CHINAMAN PACIFIC &amp; FRISCO R.R. CO. BY FRANK CHIN (COFFEE HOUSE PRESS:
$9.95; 184 PP.)
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Chicago, is seeking a publisher for his first novel.

When I think of some friends of mine from the old neighborhood (all of whom had
the proper ethnic credentials, let me assure you), one thing I remember is our
wariness of what we called "I Have a Problem" literature. By that, we meant
literature of ethnic experience at its most tiresome: brooding, Angst-ridden
story-polemics, crammed to the gills with resentment and righteous anger, about
existential misery in the Land of the Round-Eye; literature that seemed to
assume that any bit of drivel was worth your attention just as long as it had a
chip on its shoulder. It's a species related to what Calvin Trillin called the
"kvetch novel" -- any novel in which you want to say to the main character,
"Oh, just pull up your socks" -- only more irritating. But it's also an easy
trap for anyone who writes from an ethnocentric point of view to fall into. It
is, therefore, to Frank Chin's credit that his collection of short stories,
"The Chinaman Pacific &amp; Frisco R.R. Co." by and large avoids this trap even
as it dances on the edge of the pit.
</P>
<P>
There are eight stories in this volume, most of them autobiographical in tone.
Almost all have as their essential subject the alienation of Chinese-America
from the America of white skin and Wonder Bread. The first two, "Railroad
Standard Time" and "The Eat and Run Midnight People," read like meandering
stream-of-consciousness memoirs and are self-indulgent enough to make them the
weakest of the bunch. The final story, "The Sons of Chan," clothes itself in
shreds of fiction with some interesting Freudian overtones, but it is otherwise
a tiring screed on growing up with the stereotypes in Charlie Chan movies as
your only reflection in popular culture. Chin's rhetoric is often sharp and
funny, but he also rides the high horse of racial bitterness for more than it's
worth.
</P>
<P>
It's the other five stories that distinguish "The Chinaman Pacific &amp; Frisco
R.R. Co." In them, Chin displays two considerable writerly virtues. One is a
wicked sense of humor that runs a provocative gamut from jangled whimsy to
scathing satire. His subject matter is weighty enough so that an amusing
conceit or figuration often balances out the mood. This is particularly true of
"A Chinese Lady Dies," in which the narrator's problematic (and disturbingly
Oedipal) relationship with his mother evokes such tension that the story would
self-immolate without the whimsical dream passages in which he imagines himself
as an Old-Western hero called E. Chino. His wit feels more like a dagger than a
feather, but is no less amusing for it. And for good measure, Chin tacks on an
afterword that reads suspiciously like a freewheeling satire on Maxine Hong
Kingston's "The Woman Warrior."
</P>
<P>
 His other primary virtue is his considerable skill as a storyteller. He has a
genuine gift for bringing characters and their predicaments alive. One sees
this most vividly in "The Only Real Day," which focuses on the struggle of an
aged immigrant to keep American culture at bay and preserve his identity as a
Chinese. Chin has a definite point to make in this story about the corrosion of
Chinese values and identity in a mostly white world, but the message is
filtered so thoroughly through the plot and well-drawn characters that it has
no didactic harshness. It is, above all, a poignant and entrancing piece of
fiction. "Yes, Young Daddy," which depicts the protagonist's relationship with
a female cousin who is grappling with adolescence, is also worth noting for its
skillful portraiture.
</P>
<P>
Chin's prose style tends toward a looseness vaguely reminiscent of William S.
Burroughs. It's lively stuff but also slow going at times, what with the
missing antecedents, plastic sentence structure and all. He also enjoys playing
fast and loose with temporal shifts in his stories, with the result that
memory, present experience, anticipation and pure fantasy often overlap. It's
an absorbingly dense reflection of the way in which past, present and future
come to bear upon each other in the mind, but everything melds so seamlessly
that the reader may have some trouble keeping things sorted.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, Chin does a good job of avoiding the hazards that could have
swallowed up these stories. Although alienation is the great theme of
post-World War II American literature and our age is distinguished by its
voices from outside the mainstream, just because a work is about racial
alienation doesn't automatically make it worth reading. The problem with
ethnocentric literature is that its force is so centripetal. It tends to reach
inward, instead of outward toward the universal significance that, as Northrop
Frye said, marks literature in its highest form. Fiction need not reach that
level to be worth our while, but it should at least show a human dimension that
will move us and provoke us, as mere formalized pique cannot. Fortunately, "The
Chinaman Pacific &amp; Frisco R.R. Co." achieves such transcendance often
enough to make it worthwhile fiction.

The Sunday evening movie lineup is one of the strongest in memory, commencing
at 6 p.m. on Channel 5 with Mel Brooks' hilarious 1974 horror picture spoof,
Young Frankenstein, with Gene Wilder heading a terrific cast.
</P>
<P>
Chariots of Fire (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.), the 1981 multi-Oscar winner,
traces the parallel lives of two very different athletes who became part of the
remarkable British track and field team at the 1924 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Silent Victory: The Kitty O'Neil Story (Channel 9 Sunday at 7 p.m.) is an
exceptionally well-made 1979 TV movie with Stockard Channing starring in this
real-life story about a deaf woman who became one of Hollywood's top stunt
women.
</P>
<P>
If anything, Mel Brooks' 1968 debut film The Producers (Channel 5 Sunday at 8
p.m.) is even funnier than "Young Frankenstein." It's a zany farce in which
Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder come up with a cockamamie scheme to profit from
staging a terrible play.
</P>
<P>
The 1972 Frenzy (Channel 13 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is the finest of Alfred
Hitchcock's last films, a thriller set in his native London and dealing with a
man (Jon Finch) wrongly accused of being a serial killer.
</P>
<P>
The Karen Carpenter Story (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) stars Cynthia Gibb in the
title role of this new TV movie about the popular singer who died at 32 from
the affects of anorexia nervosa. Mitchell Anderson plays Carpenter's brother
and singing partner Richard.
</P>
<P>
The 1984 Gremlins (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful
Life" turned inside out, upside down and pickled in brine, a sweet-and-sour
comedy featuring an invasion of a small Middle American town by a horde of
fast-multiplying, deceptively cute, furry creatures.
</P>
<P>
The 14th James Bond adventure A View to a Kill (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a
so-so affair, with Roger Moore beginning to look a little weary as 007 (Timothy
Dalton would replace him in the next Bond, the 1987 "Living Daylights"). This
time the villain is Christopher Walken, intent on destroying Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
Watching Terry Gilliam's 1985 Brazil (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.), an
exploding cigar in the face of the future, is like watching Gilliam's head
erupt in public. Everything that has ever made an impact on the film maker
seems to be whirling by in this brilliant, exhausting, savagely funny
post-Orwellian satire, set in the gray confines of the Ministry of Information
where his shiningly innocent hero (Jonathan Pryce) toils in his cherished
anonymity. Gilliam's targets are the usual Monty Python concerns: modern
technology and the men who run it, terrorists, repairmen, bureaucrats, the
plastic surgery industry, the ad game and sticklers for detail, wherever they
are.
</P>
<P>
Terror on Highway 91 (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie, stars Ricky
Schroder in the true story of a young man who exposes police corruption in a
small southern town. George Dzundza and Matt Clark co-star.
</P>
<P>
Blake Edwards' 1979 10 (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m., again on Saturday at 10
p.m.), a modern comedy classic, stars Dudley Moore as a popular composer who,
in the clutch of middle age, pursues a beautiful young bride (Bo Derek) all the
way to Mexico, where she is honeymooning. This is a superbly constructed film
which makes shrewd observations of the American obsession with sex and youth,
California-style.
</P>
<P>
The Man in the Brown Suit (CBS Wednesday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie updating
Agatha Christie's 1924 mystery novel about a young American woman (Stephanie
Zimbalist) traveling through Egypt in search of adventure. Rue McClanahan, Tony
Randall and Edward Woodward star.
</P>
<P>
Rob Reiner's 1984 This Is Spinal Tap (Channel 28 Friday at 11:30 p.m.) is one
of the funniest movies of the decade, a delicious sendup on the making of a
rock documentary in which Reiner casts himself as a film maker trying to make a
record of a seedy English group on tour. The line between parody and reality
becomes exceedingly and riotously thin.
</P>
<P>
The dreadful 1986 comedy Armed and Dangerous (CBS Saturday at 8 p.m.) plays
like a third-generation dupe print of "Police Academy," with frantic splices
from "Beverly Hills Cop." John Candy and Eugene Levy star as a pair of goofy
misfits adrift in a Los Angeles populated entirely by bozos, nitwits, boobs and
cads.
</P>
<P>
Brian De Palma's 1983 remake of Howard Hawks' 1932 gangster classic Scarface
(ABC Saturday at 8 p.m.) moves the action from Chicago in the '20s to Miami's
Cuban community of the present, but for all its operatic razzle-dazzle, it
becomes a lurid exercise in wretched excess. Al Pacino has the title role as a
doomed drug kingpin.

PICTURING MANZANAR;
</P>
<P>
MANZANAR BY JOHN ARMOUR AND PETER WRIGHT PHOTOGRAPHS BY ANSEL ADAMS, COMMENTARY
BY JOHN HERSEY (TIMES BOOKS: $27.50; 167 PP.)
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Kishiyama , Kishiyama, a Calendar assistant editor, was born in the
Heart Mountain, Wyo., relocation camp.
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There could not be a more powerful combination than words by John Hersey and
photographs by Ansel Adams. When the subject matter is "Manzanar" and the
unconstitutional imprisoning of Japanese-Americans during World War II, the
combination would seem to be explosive -- and is.
</P>
<P>
Eloquent and moving, Hersey's 15,000-word essay details how this tragedy came
into being: "The bitterest national shame of the Second World War for the sweet
land of liberty: the mass incarceration, on racial grounds alone, on false
evidence of military necessity, and in contempt of their supposedly inalienable
rights, of an entire class of American citizens -- along with others who were
not citizens in the country of their choice only because that country had long
denied people of their race the right to naturalize."
</P>
<P>
Equally moving are Adams' photographs, originally taken to document life in
Manzanar, just a speck on the map in Inyo County in the rugged eastern Sierra
before it became one of 10 camps established to hold about 120,000
Japanese-Americans from 1942 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Hersey's contribution occupies only the first 66 pages. Worse,
Adams' pictures have been culled to less than half of the 204 pictures he
donated to the Library of Congress. Many of these historic photographs are
reproduced at sizes much smaller than snapshots developed in a hour at your
corner photo shop.
</P>
<P>
Instead of letting Hersey and Adams' words and pictures tell the story, the
book dilutes the saga and turns it into another stereotypical tale of
Japanese-Americana: how we overcame hardship and made the best of a bad
situation.
</P>
<P>
The titles of the three different contributions to the book indicate three
different approaches: outrage in Hersey's "A Mistake of Terrifically Horrible
Proportions," irony in Adams' "Born Free and Equal" and the bland in Armour and
Wright's "A Portrait of Manzanar."
</P>
<P>
Now that a redress bill has been passed by Congress and signed by the
President, which would grant every living internee $20,000, the horrifying
mistake of nearly 50 years ago has been officially rectified. But not the
lasting impression that what the government did was wrong. For chipping away at
this stone wall the book's authors and publisher have to be congratulated.
</P>
<P>
But how much better it would have been for the book to at least mention that
Ansel Adams' Manzanar photos, when put on display after 40 years, were
criticized by some Japanese-Americans as "prettifying" the harsh camp
experience. Or that many of those photographed carry hidden pyschological scars
from the war fought within. Or that most of those photographed have long since
died, never qualifying for the $20,000 and carrying to their graves the thought
that they were "guilty" as never charged.

<P>
Set in Australia at the turn of the 20th Century, "Waiting for Childhood" is
the story of seven children left to cope for themselves after their parents
die. Their father, The Rev. William Lord, expires at the breakfast table one
morning. After the family leaves for a ramshackle house owned by a wealthy
cousin, the mother loses her mind and then her life in an accident.
</P>
<P>
The eldest daughter, Lily, takes charge of the entire household, as Jess
becomes a favorite of her rich cousin Jackie and watches her rival for Jackie's
affections fall fatally from a mountaintop.
</P>
<P>
These characters, "all talented, all deeply human, (are) all so beautifully
realized that by the end of the novel we identify with them to the point of
heartbreak," Carolyn See wrote in these pages. " 'Waiting for Childhood'
manages to be at once terribly melancholy and extraordinarily exhilarating."

Penguin Books has here collected 36 of the host of "A Prairie Home Companion's"
radio monologues, each beginning with the words "it has been a quiet week in
Lake Wobegon" -- a town "where all the women are strong, the men are
good-looking, and all the children are above average."
</P>
<P>
Those who have been charmed by Keillor's wistful American pastoral will be
pleased to learn, as Dan Sullivan put it in his review, that "Keillor doesn't
ramble as much in type as he did on the air. Something else does come across
better on the page: the realization that Lake Wobegon does not exist. . . .
Every now and then, the whole town starts to waver, like a mirage, and you see
Keillor . . . wondering whether to send a character into her house to discover
the mess that her kids have made, or to let her take a walk around the block
first."

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE RACE TO FASHODA EUROPEAN COLONIALISM AND AFRICAN

On May 10, 1896, acting on a report by French engineer Victor Prompt that the
headwaters of the Nile could be dammed up, "turning the great waterway on and
off like a bathtub spigot," Capt. Jean-Baptiste Marchand sails from Marseilles
to the French Congo and begins his trek across Africa to the Nile with 150-odd
Senegalese soldiers. They arrive in Fashoda in July, 1898.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the British launch an Anglo-Egyptian army of 30,000 men under
the leadership of Herbert Kitchener. These men build a railroad across the
desert, meet up with another 60,000-man army and arrive in Fashoda in
September, 1898.
</P>
<P>
"On September 19, Marchand and Kitchener exchanged champagne toasts aboard a
British gunboat anchored off Fashoda before politely threatening to destroy
each other," David Levering Lewis writes in this absorbing history. "On
November 4, Paris ordered recently promoted Major Marchand to abandon his
fortress."
</P>
<P>
Drawing from the archives of African states, from newly translated political
correspondence as well as memoirs, Lewis exposes the sometimes absurd imperial
energies of European states and the emerging role of African nations.

Negotiations are under way for Dustin Hoffman to play the title role in
Warners' on-again, off-again "Phantom" -- the opera story updated to
Nazi-occupied Germany. Originally at Lorimar, the script's recently been
revamped by James Dearden ("Fatal Attraction"), with filming to begin in April.
Wolfgang Petersen directs and co-produces with C.O. Erickson. . . . Family
ties: Actor-producer James Keach makes his directorial debut with "The
Forgotten," the story of Vietnam MIAs released after 17 years' imprisonment.
But a sinister plot develops when the soldiers are debriefed in Berlin. It
stars Keith Carradine, Stacy Keach and Steve Railsback, who
co-wrote/co-produces with Keach, James. Mimi Maynard and Sandra Will,
respectively the wives of James Keach and Carradine, also have roles.
Production starts late January for Paramount. . . .

Emily Lloyd will star in "Letters for Iris," the story of a young woman who
becomes a nanny as a means to avenge a terrible wrong. Israel Horvitz wrote the
yarn, which films late spring in Boston, for producer Robert Lawrence. Burt
Young joins Joseph Mantegna and Faye Dunaway in Zoetrope's "Wait Until Spring,
Bandini," filming in Utah next February. Fred Roos, Erwin Provoost and Tom
Luddy produce the story of immigrant life in the 1920s. Dominique Deruddere is
writer-director. Tom Waits will score. . . .

Madonna and Beatty?

A Madonna rep tells us -- and production sources confirm -- that the blond
bombshell will play '30s nightclub singer-gangster's moll Breathless Mahoney
opposite Warren, who has the title role in the long-delayed "Dick Tracy."
</P>
<P>
As Breathless she'll sing at least two original songs, yet unwritten. And
she'll attempt to seduce the straight-laced copper away from lady love Tess
Trueheart, who is yet to be cast.
</P>
<P>
Beatty produces/directs the $30 million-plus Touchstone film, to begin
production in February, to be filmed on the Universal lot, according to
sources. Craig Modderno

Rodriguez's interview with corporate attorney Elsa Banuelos was dismaying.
Banuelos states that she is "tired of translating" when called upon by client
or other attorneys to assist them with the busboys. Would Banuelos feel just as
tired, or rather, embarrassed, to translate while negotiating a contract with
another attorney or a Spanish-speaking client? I think not. It is unfortunate
that Banuelos is not proud of her ability to converse in Spanish, even if it is
only used to ask the busboy for another glass of water.

Leo Estrada's suggested model of middle-class Mexican-Americans creating
country clubs for ourselves so as to pass on our advantages to our young is
probably unnecessary. Instead, the Latino professionals profiled in the article
could directly benefit the next Mexican-American generation by teaching them
their skills. For example, the Cal Poly Pomona campus (where I teach) boasts
14% Latino students, and its School of Business Administration, with the
largest number of declared majors on campus who are Latino and black, regularly
hires practicing financial consultants and lawyers on a visiting, part-time
basis. Although the money isn't great, sweet satisfactions can derive from
having a Latino student earn the top grade on a corporate finance exam (as just
happened to me) or from submitting a proposal to the National Science
Foundation to establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site where
students may, under my guidance, undertake a yearlong study of attitudes and
experiences of Latino MBAs in U.S. corporations.

ART NEWS: AN EXHIBIT WHOSE TIME HAS COME
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phyllis Plous admits that six years is a long time to put together any exhibit.
Her timing seems auspicious, however. When the curator began organizing a show
of abstract painting in 1982, in her words, the art form was "relegated to the
dust bins." Today, as "Abstract Options" is about to open, that is all changed.
</P>
<P>
"There's been a definite acceleration of interest in abstraction since the
mid-'80s," said Plous, who with Frances Colpitt co-curated the 32-painting
exhibit, opening Friday at UC Santa Barbara's University Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
The project began when Colpitt, a critic and art historian, arrived at UCSB to
teach, said Plous, University Art Museum curator. "Neo Expressionism was so
rampant at the time and we began to wonder why we only saw Abstract art in
artists' studios."
</P>
<P>
Ten contemporary artists from the east and west coasts are represented in the
show. The co-curators chose artists that differed in their treatment of surface
and form, but shared a preference for a lush richness.
</P>
<P>
"The show perhaps is about sensuality and the process of painting," Plous said.
"Unlike Neo-Geo, this is not dry illustrative abstraction. I don't like the
word pretty very much, but I think it's going to be a beautiful show."
</P>
<P>
Artists in the exhibit are Edith Baumann-Hudson, Moira Dryer, Heidi Gluck,
Nancy Haynes, James Hayward, Mary Heilmann, Julian Lethbridge, John M. Miller,
Paul Mogensen and Stephen Westfall. It is scheduled to run in Santa Barbara
through Feb. 26, then travel to Evanston, Ill., and Santa Clara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
RETIRING: Artist La Monte Westmoreland, who established Los Angeles' most
active high school-based gallery, will retire this month to concentrate on his
own artwork after 10 years as director of Roberts Art Gallery at Santa Monica
High School.
</P>
<P>
"I just need to have more studio time," Westmoreland said, now making mostly
mixed-media collages shown at Lizardi/Harp Gallery in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
Lita Albuquerque, John Swihart, Laddie John Dill, Guy Dill and Sandra Mendelson
Rubin lead an illustrious list of local artists, many of them alumni of the
high school, who regularly took part in Westmoreland's exhibits.
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica-based artist Peter Alexander, who for several years donated works
for annual auctions to support the gallery, lauded Westmoreland's efforts that
he said turned the space, founded in 1935, into a unique showcase for local
emerging and established artists that particularly benefited the high school's
students.
</P>
<P>
"The whole deal was La Monte's doing," said Alexander, one of this city's
best-known painters whose two daughters went to Santa Monica High School. "His
enthusiasm, in terms of bringing work to the students, has been quite
extraordinary."
</P>
<P>
Ann Goodwin, a painting instructor at the high school, will succeed
Westmoreland, whose final exhibit, "Paintings and Sculptures," Jan. 5 through
Jan. 26, features eight artists. (See art openings for details.)
</P>
<P>
LACE GRANTS: Local interdisciplinary artists developing new work may apply for
grants from Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE), now in the fourth year
of its Grant Program for Interdisciplinary Artists. More than $30,200 are
available for individuals or groups of artists working collaboratively. For
information and an application, call LACE at (213) 624-5650. June Scott heads
up the program.
</P>
<P>
IN PUBLIC: Public art and its preservation, issues of increasing concern
nationwide, are the theme of a new publication. "Going Public: A Field Guide to
Developments in Art in Public Places" was produced with the input of 30
nationally recognized artists, public art administrators, design professionals
and others brought together by the National Endowment for the Arts to examine
public art issues. For information, contact the Arts Education Service at the
University of Massachusetts, (413) 545-2360.

Chicken is chicken, right? Well, not always, it appears. A new catalogue of
chicken-based products available from Pierce Foods -- a leading supplier of
pre-cooked menu items to the food service industry -- offers well over 200
variations on the theme. There's Hume Dingher's 39 Seasonings Fast-Fry chicken,
for instance ("Leave it to Hume to pack 39 herbs and spices, sea salts, and
vegetables into one chicken recipe"). Or Greek Odyssey Chicken Breast Fillets
("IT'S MICROWAVEABLE!"). Or Marinata Americana Chicken Thigh Fillets ("Here is
a chicken fillet with a touch of greatness -- a lighter blend of those Central
and Southern European spices America loves best").
</P>
<P>
Other varieties of Pierce poulet include Marinata/LS (Low Sodium) Curried Brest
(sic), Microwaveable Wing-Dings, Roman-Fingers, Dip'n Chik'n Nuggets, Taste
O'Mesquite Whole Halves (sic), Chik-Nachos and both Whirligigs and Whirlibirds
(the latter, of course, being "Fully cooked, breaded chicken breast-and-thigh
meat patties . . . seasoned with sage and onion croutons").
</P>
<P>
It's nice to know that somebody like Pierce is out there making the
restaurateur's life easier, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
READ MY LICKS: What will (gulp) President Bush and Vice-President Quayle be
eating on the evening of Inauguration Day? Hearts-of-palm blossoms,
asiago-garlic bread and pheasant pizza, among other things. They'll be sampling
these and other exotic delicacies at a reception in a new restaurant in the
nation's capital called Adirondacks. Adirondacks, which is the work of L.A.'s
own Michael McCarty (of Michael's in Santa Monica) and chef Jimmy Schmidt --
who also own the Rattlesnake Clubs in Denver and Detroit -- is an appropriate
site for a presidential reception, as it happens, since it occupies the old
presidential suite at Washington's Union Station, built for the use of Teddy
Roosevelt. (Adirondacks was originally going to be yet another Rattlesnake
Club, incidentally, but McCarty and Schmidt felt that an East-coast sort of
name would be more appropriate. Personally, I think the Rattlesnake Club is a
great name for a restaurant a few blocks from Capitol Hill.)
</P>
<P>
"We're just going to serve wild hors d'oeuvres," says Schmidt. "You know those
politician types. They like to stay on their feet and pump a lot of hands.
They'll probably be so busy talking that they'll only take little bites of
things -- so I've got to get my licks in quick."
</P>
<P>
Among those licks will be spicy shrimp with achiote and picaya (hearts-of-palm
blossoms) on lemon-bread croutons, asiago-garlic bread with black and green
olive tapenade, and that pheasant pizza with the addition of Chinese-style plum
sauce, hot mustard and mozzarella.
</P>
<P>
Hey, wait a minute. Isn't Bush the guy who made fun of Michael Dukakis for
talking about Belgian endive?
</P>
<P>
SALT AND PEPPER: Cafe Prego is new on La Cienega, on the site of the former
L'Angolo (among other restaurants). . . . Marc Ehrler, former chef for the
French ambassador in Washington, is the new executive chef at the San Ysidro
Ranch in Montecito. Ehrler replaces Bryan Carr, who has moved to the El Encanto
Hotel in Santa Barbara. . . .

I find it very disappointing that The Times would refer to someone as
close-minded and ridiculous as Tracey Ullman as a "tastemaker" (Taste Makers,
Dec. 25).
</P>
<P>
Anyone who lives, (and very well I might add!) in this city and feels that
theater here does not merit her very valuable time has not looked very far. I'm
sure that Ms. Ullman could find something to satisfy her superior taste.
</P>
<P>
If she finds Los Angeles and this country in fact to be a cultural or artistic
desert, then perhaps she should move back to London and have her tea there, or
would that hit here where it hurts, her pocketbook!

STENCILING
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH SIMS
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUDDENLY POPULAR after nearly a century of neglect, stencil painting now
decorates nursery walls and furniture, living and dining room walls and floors.
Stenciling became prominent in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, when it
was used to imitate wallpaper. In the American colonies, stenciled designs were
used on floors, on furniture and on canvas or oilcloth floor coverings.
</P>
<P>
The process is simple: A stenciler, using a craft knife, cuts various shapes in
a piece of sturdy, usually waxed, paper, and then applies paint to a surface
through those cutouts. The beauty of stenciling is the ease of repetition:
Complicated swag-and-bouquet borders can be applied to walls in a fraction of
the time (and without the requisite talent) it would take someone to paint them
by hand. Stenciling can be a very satisfying craft, because the end result,
when done well, looks professionally neat and precise.
</P>
<P>
Although stenciling is easy enough to attempt on your own -- with just some
paper, a craft knife, paint and brushes -- a small test project before
launching into a total-room experience is a good idea. The hardest thing to
master is the correct consistency of the paint. Think dry. And the stencil
brush (shaped like a blunt, long-handled shaving brush) should be wielded with
an up-and-down motion; wiping brings disaster. The surface to be stenciled
determines the consistency of the paint; cloth can take more paint on the
brush, but a floor previously painted with something like diamond-hard deck
enamel will resist all paint.
</P>
<P>
 Many how-to books on stenciling have been published; Dover Books has issued a
series of books of stencil designs on thick paper, ready for cutting.
Stenciling supplies and classes are offered at Judy's Carousel Crafts and

DAT AND LUDDITES
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding John C. Dvorak's Dec. 11 Viewpoints column, "Why DAT Isn't
Un-American":
</P>
<P>
I must agree with Dvorak. It is not digital audio tape that is un-American, but
rather the Recording Industry Assn. of America itself.
</P>
<P>
The attitudes and actions of the RIAA very closely parallel those of the
Luddites, the early 19th-Century English workmen who destroyed labor-saving
machinery to "protect" the economy. The Luddites could not see that if textiles
could be more easily manufactured and sold for less, more people could afford
more of them.
</P>
<P>
In the same way, the RIAA was wrong about standard audio cassettes, wrong about
videocassette recorders and now also wrong about DAT. Audio cassettes boosted
sales of long-playing records, and VCRs boosted motion picture revenues. The
RIAA would like to punish the entire country for the supposed wrongs of the
proverbial bootlegging pirates. This is not only unfair but ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
The RIAA's special-interest politicking may have hurt the introduction of DAT,
but it won't be able to stop read/write compact discs. Everything seems to be
going digital. It's just a matter of time.

'89 WISH LIST: PROTECTION, TAXES AND PEACE;
</P>
<P>
SOCIAL BENEFITS, DEFICIT REDUCTION ARE TOP PRIORITIES FOR THE NEW YEAR
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What changes would you like to see in business practices and the workplace this
year? How can business leaders and economic policy-makers improve the economy
and the world in general in 1989? The Times ran these questions by people in
various walks of life, and here are some of their answers:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Muriel Siebert, head of the Muriel Siebert &amp; Co. discount brokerage in New
York, and first female member of the New York Stock Exchange:
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see certain business practices regulated. I think that the
leveraged buyouts show the greed of people at their worst. . . . The LBOs are
bypassing the purpose of the capital-raising system. I think that to the extent
that people were stockholders in these companies . . . they should be allowed
to continue to have some kind of share in the profits (after the leveraged
buyouts) because these moves were done while they were stockholders.
</P>
<P>
"Must greed be the creed? I would like to see that also rolled over to our
defense contractors. I am pro defense. I believe in a strong country because
people mistake gentility for weakness. If (contractors) cheat on defense
contracts, I don't see why they don't go to jail. . . . I just feel that if you
are a major defense contractor, you owe a fiduciary responsibility to this
country because defense expenditures are putting a pretty big toll on the
country."
</P>
<P>
Andrew Brimmer, former member of the Federal Reserve Board and head of a
Washington economics consulting firm:
</P>
<P>
"My leading wish is that the nation deal with the federal budget deficit. I
would like to see a substantial reduction in 1989 and extending over the next
three years. I would strongly recommend that we raise taxes. There should be
some moderation in the level of government expenditures, but the real problem
is the lag in revenue.
</P>
<P>
"I also would like to see more done for education by business. The kind of
education I'm talking about is at the elementary and secondary level.
Businesses are already contributing to colleges. Businesses should do likewise
for elementary and secondary schools. Business people can play a role as
counselors and teachers. A firm might make available an engineer or
mathematician to go into schools and teach. Business should do more to offer
on-the-job training for unskilled, or limited-skills, people, perhaps through a
(lower) learning wage. We would give business tax credits to do this."
</P>
<P>
William R. Robertson, executive secretary of the Los Angeles County Federation
of Labor, AFL-CIO:
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see a change in philosophy by the incoming President relating
to labor relations and providing for fairness in our (labor) organizing efforts
and contract negotiations. . . .
</P>
<P>
"I would also like to see some protection for workers losing their jobs because
of mergers. It is a national disgrace. In too many mergers, the workers are the
ones that suffer and the country as well. Something should be done to correct
it. . . .
</P>
<P>
"And, finally, this Administration should face reality in resolving the
astronomical deficit."
</P>
<P>
Steven D. Lydenberg, an associate with the "socially responsible" investment
firm of Franklin Research &amp; Development:
</P>
<P>
"There is an increasing interest around the country in social investing. People
want to know not just the financial implications of making a commitment in a
company, but also the social implication. That information is not very easy to
come by.
</P>
<P>
"So, if at the end of '89 corporations were disclosing in a uniform way their
yield figures, their charitable contribution figures, the numbers of women and
minorities in top management and board directors, their attitude on a number of
comparable social issues, I would be very happy."
</P>
<P>
Frank Borman, chairman of Patlex Corp. of Chatsworth, former astronaut and
former chairman of Eastern Airlines:
</P>
<P>
"We should begin to move toward taxing consumption -- a value-added tax. This
is quite controversial as Al Ullman (Oregon Democrat and former chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee, who was defeated in 1988 after advocating a
value-added tax) will tell you. But this taxing system is needed. It would
certainly help our exports. Almost all of Europe is under the value-added
taxing system. Also, it may encourage saving instead of consumption. One of the
ways you discourage consumption is to tax it."
</P>
<P>
Michael Harrington, co-chair of Democratic Socialists of America and author of
"The Other America" and "The New American Poverty":
</P>
<P>
"I hope Secretary of State Baker will build on the basic insights of former
Treasury Secretary Baker (James Baker, former treasury secretary, was nominated
by President-elect Bush to be Secretary of State) that a settlement of Third
World debt is in the self-interest of America, opening up markets for business
and labor. But then the new Baker will have to go far beyond the old, since
Latin America now owes more than it did in 1982 when the crisis officially
began, and several countries, including Argentina and Brazil, may see democracy
subverted if current trends persist.
</P>
<P>
"At home, the nation must recognize that we can't waste young people, and
particularly minorities and women, on illiteracy, unemployment and unproductive
low-wage work. We must invest mightily in education, training and job
generation."
</P>
<P>
Alan Bromberg, a securities law expert and professor at Southern Methodist
University:
</P>
<P>
"There are several things I would like most to see changed in the economy and
business practices. One, more concentration by business and government, both
here and abroad, on . . . the facilitation of international trade and
investment. This would require wider horizons for business people . . . and
more effort by government to reduce and ultimately eliminate all kinds of
restrictions on the movement of products.
</P>
<P>
"Two, I would like to see a national consensus developed, preferably in the
form of federal legislation, on corporate takeovers and buyouts that would
recognize the efficiencies and benefits they bring as well as the dislocations
and hardships they can cause. This would involve tax policies and labor polices
and limitations on the ability of states to Balkanize corporate law by
different anti-takeover statutes everywhere. (There also should be) some kind
of limitation on management self-entrenchment and self-enrichment.
</P>
<P>
"I think we could use a lot of clarification of the securities laws. I think
the courts have done a good job of saying what insider trading is. The kind of
issues that are most difficult are what really is parking (of stock)? How much
cooperation or similar action by different individuals or different groups of
individuals makes it collaboration? These issues haven't been well resolved. .
. .
</P>
<P>
Peter Bahouth, executive director of Greenpeace in Washington:
</P>
<P>
"People now view threats to human security less in terms of political threats
and more in environmental and economic terms. So for my wish list, I would ask
first that we deal with the issue of the greenhouse effect. We better develop
some alternative views in mass transportation and cut subsidies to reflect the
true cost of fossil fuels in terms of pollution, along with the actual economic
cost of development. Then, we could put more money into research and
development of wind and solar energy.
</P>
<P>
"(Also on my wish list is) peace on earth. If we want peace on earth, we have
to start looking seriously at the fact that we are making more and more
weapons, and in a process which endangers the health of American people. . . .
Production plants have been proven to have released into the air and water
radioactivity and toxic chemicals."
</P>
<P>
"Also, it would be nice if we could learn that the rain forest affects all of
us. We need to preserve it. And we would like the tuna industry to stop killing
dolphins."

MEDIAN HOME PRICES, SALES UP IN NOVEMBER
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Median prices and sales of resale detached houses and condominiums rose in
November, according to the California Assn. of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
November sales of detached houses in California rose 4.9% over October, thanks
to a brief dip in interest rates and strong demand.
</P>
<P>
Detached houses sold at an annual rate of 597,000 in November compared to
569,330 in October. The November figure was 17% higher than last November
making it the highest in a decade.
</P>
<P>
The state's median sales price for resale houses rose 1.2% in November to
$177,485. This was a 23.6% jump from November, 1987, when the median was
$143,554. Joel Singer, chief economist of the realtors' group, said lack of
inventory helped to cause the price rise.
</P>
<P>
Condominium resales rose 0.2% over October but 48.4% over November, 1987. The
median condominium price fell 2.7%, to $126,328 in November from $129,869 in
October. Even so, November's median price was 10.4% higher than a year ago,
when it was $114,457.

INTERIOR DESIGN IMPORTANT TO VISUALLY IMPAIRED PERSONS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Interior design can have more impact on the visually impaired than on those who
see normally, according Jean Bast of the San Diego chapter of the American
Society of Interior Designers.
</P>
<P>
Chapter members have been volunteering their services to redesigning and
renovating the San Diego Service Center for the Blind, using techniques and
design applications that will transform it into an integrated "way-finding"
facility.
</P>
<P>
Most furnishings are also being donated to the $500,000 renovation of the
8,000-square-foot center. Design applications will include the use of brightly
colored accents on walls and floors, improved overhead lighting to reduce
glare, lighting in handrails and heavily textured walls, said Jan Bast, the
chairman of the ASID design team.
</P>
<P>
"To call this a center for the blind is somewhat a misnomer, since most of the
people utilizing the center are partially sighted," Bast added.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80% of the 2,200 people using the San Diego facility are elderly, and
design efforts have also gone into special furnishings for that group. For the
totally blind, different, heavily textured wall coverings and varying floor
surfaces will enhance their ability to find their way.

THE BUSH YEARS: 1;
</P>
<P>
PAYING FOR THE REAGAN REVOLUTION
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two predictions for 1989: There isn't going to be a Bush Revolution. But George
Bush will have to pay the price for the Reagan Revolution.
</P>
<P>
We know there won't be a Bush Revolution because, with one exception, none of
the people Bush has appointed to policy-making positions is a revolutionary.
They are in the mold of Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III, who
was reviled by conservatives when he was Ronald Reagan's chief of staff; Atty.
Gen. Richard Thornburgh, who has served in the Nixon, Ford and Reagan
administrations; Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who is closer to Wall
Street than to the supply-siders on the Republican right, and Brent Scowcroft,
Bush's national security adviser, who is known to harbor serious doubts about
Reagan's "Star Wars" program. In other words, Bush has assembled a team of
cautious, moderate, pragmatic, Establishment Republicans.
</P>
<P>
The one exception is Jack Kemp, Bush's proposed secretary of housing and urban
development. Kemp has never held an executive position before, and he is
brimming over with radical new ideas. Kemp's is regarded as a token appointment
to a secondary Cabinet position, however, made to mollify the GOP's right wing.
(Quiz: Who is Reagan's secretary of housing and urban development? Hint: He is
the only Cabinet member who served for Reagan's entire two terms. Give up?
Here's another hint: He is the only black in Reagan's Cabinet. Still stumped?
The answer is Samuel R. Pierce Jr. If you didn't know, don't worry. Reagan
himself didn't recognize Pierce at a White House reception several years ago.)
</P>
<P>
Actually, radical new ideas are what is needed for dealing with the major
problem under Kemp's purview, namely, the national scandal of homelessness.
</P>
<P>
Other than Kemp, the only controversial appointments Bush has made were to
political rather than policy-making positions -- John H. Sununu as White House
chief of staff, Lee Atwater as Republican Party chairman and Dan Quayle as vice
president. None has to be confirmed by the Senate. And the Bush people are
still trying to figure out something for Quayle to do.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, when it comes to policy positions, there are no James P. Watts, no
William J. Caseys, no Edwin Meese IIIs, no William J. Bennetts. The Reagan
Administration gave us bold new ideas. The Bush Administration will give us
something we rarely got from Reagan -- professionalism.
</P>
<P>
Congress seems impressed by Bush's professionalism. Even Democrats express
admiration for the professionalism of his presidential campaign. "It was a
nasty campaign," said House Majority Whip Tony Coelho (D-Merced), "but
basically it was a professional campaign. They knew what had to be done and
they did it."
</P>
<P>
Right now, we are in one of the rare periods of make-nice in Washington. Bush's
efforts to bind up the wounds of the campaign are paying off. He has bought
himself a honeymoon. Conservatives are holding their fire; they don't want to
be seen as abandoning the new President before he even takes office. The press
is happy because the President-elect has held more press conferences this year
than the President.
</P>
<P>
Congress and Bush are engaged in an elaborate Alphonse-and-Gaston routine. Each
side expresses great admiration for the other. One says, "Oh please, you be the
first to reveal your budget plans." "Oh no, I couldn't possibly," says the
other. "Please, you go first." As in the court of the Sun King at Versailles,
the ritual courtesy masks a deadly clash of ambitions. Each side wants to seize
the dagger and drive it into the other's heart.
</P>
<P>
Taxes are the dagger. He who proposes new taxes gets it in the neck. As Sen.
John Breaux (D-La.), the new chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, put it, "Bush is the one who laid down the gauntlet -- read my lips,
no new taxes. If we go out and break his promise for him, we get the blame for
it and he gets the credit. No one wants to fall into that trap."
</P>
<P>
In other words, as soon as the deficit comes up, the honeymoon ends. It will be
hard for Bush to do what Reagan has done for the last eight years, namely,
pretend the deficit is not his problem.
</P>
<P>
Bush will also pay the price for Reagan's foreign policy. In this case, a break
with the Republican right is inevitable. The right always resented the fact
that Reagan abandoned his "evil empire" agenda in order to pursue arms control
and detente. They dared not protest, however. "Reagan could always go over our
heads to our own people at the grass roots," said conservative activist Paul
Weyrich. "Bush won't be able to do that. He needs us." Bush and Scowcroft do
not show much enthusiasm for "Star Wars." Bush and Baker have decided to
postpone asking Congress for new military aid to the Contras. The Reagan
Administration, with Bush's full support, has begun talking to the Palestine
Liberation Organization. Some time this year, conservatives are going to say,
"Enough!"
</P>
<P>
Bush will also pay the price for Reagan's social agenda. Here the break will be
not with Congress or the GOP right, but with the American public. It will
happen as soon as the Supreme Court reverses its historic 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision that defined abortion as a constitutionally protected human right.
Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who wrote Roe vs. Wade, has warned that abortion
rights may soon "go down the drain." Four of the nine current Supreme Court
justices want to overturn the Roe decision, and three of Roe's supporters are
in their 80s.
</P>
<P>
Roe will go. And when that happens, all hell will break loose. "Taking away
rights that have already been given is a hard thing to pull off," said Kate
Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League.
Millions of American women have had abortions. Despite increased restrictions,
the abortion rate has remained steady at 1.5 million a year during the Reagan
years. A decision recriminalizing abortion will be as divisive for Republicans
as the 1954 school desegregation decision was for Democrats. Reagan was lucky.
He demanded an end to abortions but it didn't happen on his watch. Bush won't
be so lucky.

MIXING SIGNALS ON CAPITOL GRIDLOCK
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, Sherry Bebitch Jeffe is senior asssociate of the
Center for Politics and Policy at the Claremont Graduate School.
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Go-o-o-d morning, Sacramento! Californians have some New Year's resolutions to
propose:
</P>
<P>
 -- Balance Proposition 103's attack on soaring insurance premiums with curbs
on claim costs and attorney fees.
</P>
<P>
 -- Take responsibility for restructuring the Gann spending limit to fit
current budget realities and quit bucking tough fiscal decisions to the voters.
</P>
<P>
 -- Address the issues raised by the FBI sting, initiative mania and the
Speakership wars by a comprehensive approach to government reform and not
merely cosmetic tinkering.
</P>
<P>
 -- Face the critical questions of what the quality of life in California
should be and who should pay for it -- and stop ducking complex issues like
health care, the environment, toxics, transportation, growth controls and
regional government.
</P>
<P>
How realistic are these resolutions? That's not easy to predict. Because what
happens in Sacramento in 1989 will depend primarily on Gov. George Deukmejian,
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and the onslaught of reapportionment.
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's decision whether or not to seek reelection will influence policy
direction. Will he be persuaded to run by advisers who argue he has the best
chance to keep the governor's chair Republican and thus prevent a Democratic
gerrymander in the 1991 reapportionment?
</P>
<P>
Or, looking toward retirement, will he opt to abandon his stubborn naysaying
and attempt to build a legacy?
</P>
<P>
Early signals are mixed. After mellowing on Gann limit revisions, he's again
mulling wholesale budget chopping.
</P>
<P>
The pledge that Speaker Brown recently made to ease up on politicking and
concentrate on policy-making could also help chart a positive course for state
government. Again, signals are mixed -- in view of the partisan sniping at
Deukmejian's nominee for state treasurer by Brown's lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
The Speaker's definition of "doing policy" is crucial. Policy-making is not
selectively taking over legislators' bills and ramming them through the
Assembly. A "boutique" approach to problem-solving is not leadership.
</P>
<P>
A leader allows lawmakers to nurture their own programs, and then protects
their bills through the entire Legislature and the governor's office, too. He
stands up to special interests who fund legislative campaigns and then stymie
legislative action. (In 1989, the real test will be if Brown opposes the
state's trial lawyers, key political supporters, for enactment of comprehensive
insurance reform.)
</P>
<P>
But the strongest influence may be reapportionment. To make policy, legislators
have to get elected, and governors need legislative majorities of their own
party.
</P>
<P>
Will Assembly Republicans, led by their confrontational leader, Ross Johnson of
La Habra, frustrate policy through partisan, obstructionist games designed to
wound the Democratic majority before reapportionment?
</P>
<P>
Will dissident legislative Democrats quiet down in exchange for a "kinder,
gentler" redistricting?
</P>
<P>
Will incumbents and leaders of both parties opt to play it safe -- and not risk
any new policy initiatives before reapportionment can assure their continued
political survival?
</P>
<P>
Who can predict whether 1989 will bring an end to Sacramento's political
gridlock? The denizens of the state Capitol might prefer to hibernate until
reapportionment season. But perhaps, as Assemblyman Richard Katz of Sepulveda
speculated, "If more solutions don't start coming out of this place, then no
one will be around for reapportionment."

ITALY DEBATES A CAPITAL IDEA -- DOWN WITH ROME!
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Was the decision to make Rome the capital of Italy, taken in the last century,
a mistake even bigger than the Colosseum itself?
</P>
<P>
Yes, says Luigi Firpo, a history professor at Turin University and one of the
luminaries among Italian intelligentsia. His opinion has probably been held by
millions of other Italians since Rome actually became the Italian capital in
1870. It is an opinion likely to gain adherents in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Many Romans, or those who call themselves Romans, agree that the Eternal City
seems each day less likely to hold on to that defiant label much longer. For
them, Rome entered an alarming new chapter around AD 1950, the year when
everyone who could switched from bicycles to cars, and folks flocked in from
the hills to join the Roman circus.
</P>
<P>
Firpo, who now also sits in Parliament, has said that the degradation of Rome
is total. The Romans are vulgar, arrogant and ignorant, he claims, and the city
"does not deserve to be the capital." For him, Rome is "the only Levantine city
without a European quarter."
</P>
<P>
His remarks, uttered first in Parliament then repeated and expanded in
interviews, brought a denial from his political party that he was speaking for
them, and then angry words from the city's political bosses. Some of their
responses were impoverished, falling back on the line that Rome was the natural
capital because it once had been the capital of the Western World.
</P>
<P>
This, Firpo said, was "imperial rhetoric." Harking back to the empire was also
one of Benito Mussolini's gambits, when the Italian dictator was playing from
his balcony to cheering Roman crowds. Mussolini spoke of his Rome as being the
city's third incarnation. First, the Rome of the Caesars, then the Rome of the
Popes and finally the Rome of his glorious new Fascist regime.
</P>
<P>
Prince Metternich, the 19th-Century Austrian statesman, dismissed the Italy of
his time as being "more a geographical expression than a country." A little
later, Firpo's native Piedmont, the northwestern Italian region that borders
Switzerland and France, produced a handful of noblemen who thought that Italy
should become a unified nation for the first time since the fall of the Roman
Empire. In 1861 the Piedmontese Parliament declared that one day Rome would be
the new Italian capital. The rest of the country was then under foreign
domination; Rome and other parts of Italy were ruled by the Pope.
</P>
<P>
When the Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed in Turin, one unification supporter,
the Marquis Massimo D'Azeglio, said, "We've created an Italy -- now we must
create the Italians." A strong argument could be made that his second goal is
still a long way off.
</P>
<P>
To relieve the Pope of his temporal powers, the Piedmontese entered Rome on
Sept. 20, 1870, set up their king in what until the day before had been the
Pope's residence and found themselves in possession of a city of fewer than
200,000 people, living in a poverty unknown elsewhere on the Italian peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Today Rome's official population is 3 million, but each day it continues to
attract migrants from hill towns and farms, drawn like moths to the bright
lights. They soon find themselves living in shantytowns on the outskirts,
without electricity or even plumbing. The arches of Roman aqueducts, built
2,000 years ago to supply water for Nero's baths, are now bricked up by
migrants and serve as dwellings.
</P>
<P>
A cover story on a feisty Italian weekly, Espresso, some time ago was titled,
"When the Capital Is Corrupt -- the Nation Is Infected." That was, and probably
is, the attitude of Milan or any other modern metropolitan area in northern
Italy toward the nation's capital. Each year the northern regions see their tax
payments shipped to Rome for distribution in favor of southern Italy, an area
just as rich in natural resources as the north and with double the
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Moravia, the dean of Italian novelists, now a spry 83, is a Rome
native. He was one of the first to jump on Firpo for his remarks, reminding him
that when the Piedmontese entered Rome, they demolished many splendid buildings
and private gardens to make Rome "more modern." A few days later, Moravia
recalled that he himself had written against Rome a few years back and offered
proof that Firpo was not all that original in his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
Moravia had said: "Rome is not worthy of the name of being a European capital,
like Paris or London. It is not a model for the nation to follow, but a sterile
bureaucratic sponge that absorbs everything and gives nothing. Though the
center of the church, it is the world's least spiritual city. Religion is
present more with its bureaucracy than with its sentiment . . . . There is no
circulation of ideas and persons in Rome, meaning there is no society of
either."
</P>
<P>
When Firpo was asked where he would prefer to have the Italian capital, he
said, "Somewhere near Chiusi, but in open country." Both he and Moravia agree
that Chiusi -- an old Etruscan town midway between Rome and Florence -- is only
their utopian dream. It is too late for an Italian Pretoria, Canberra, Brasilia
or Washington, even though with their cars, Italy's central government and the
entire elephantine bureaucracy are destroying the remains of both ancient and
modern Rome with a wanton thoroughness that would give pause to Attila the Hun.
</P>
<P>
If it had not been deemed necessary to dislodge the Pope from his temporal
control over Rome, some of the Piedmontese were touting Naples as the nation's
capital. It was, after all, the largest Italian city and still a major cultural
influence in Europe. However, the Sicilians said they would never again accept
Naples as a sovereign seat.
</P>
<P>
What a pity. The Neapolitans have been living by their wits for centuries. They
are clever about inventing jobs and pulling rabbits out of other peoples' hats.
They are nimble, too, as people who choose to live under a smoldering volcano
need to be. They have produced great painters, poets, composers, writers,
architects -- while Rome has failed to produce even one.
</P>
<P>
Had Naples become the Italian capital 100 years ago, it would have tilted the
scale in favor of the Italian peninsula becoming a Mediterranean country, not
what it is now -- an angry mix, half-European and half-Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
That is what Luigi Firpo's rage against Rome is all about. He spoke for
millions of Italians who consider themselves European, and, incidentally,
probably spoke also for foreign Europeans who must do business in Italy and who
find themselves beating their heads against the city's bureaucratic rubber
wall.
</P>
<P>
The only way out of this Italian dilemma is for the north to secede from the
union. Both sides would be winners.

NICARAGUA STRUGGLES TO AID ITS CHILDREN
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Harry Nelson, Harry Nelson, a former health and medical writer for The
Times, specializes in Third World health issues.
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
MANAGUA, NICARAGUA
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight years of socially and economically devastating war with U.S.-backed
Contra forces -- topped off 10 weeks ago by the most destructive hurricane in
decades -- have sucked much of the substance but not the spirit from
Nicaragua's 3.6 million people.
</P>
<P>
A few years ago Nicaraguans talked enthusiastically of government campaigns to
reduce infant mortality, eradicate malaria, distribute land to the landless and
wipe out illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
For a while great strides were made toward realizing those goals. But today,
for the first time since the revolution that overthrew dictator Anastasio
Somoza in 1979, children beg on the streets as government officials reluctantly
slash health programs that once drew international praise.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to help hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguan children who have been
displaced, wounded, orphaned or otherwise traumatized by the Contra war, the
U.S. Congress appropriated $17.7 million. Two days after President Reagan
signed the bill on Oct. 1, President Daniel Ortega said Nicaragua would not
accept the money.
</P>
<P>
To Nicaraguans, refusing the aid was a symbol of dignity and national pride.
Tied to the legislation was a second bill that provided a similar amount in
non-lethal aid to the Contras, the very forces whose attacks on civilian
outposts were -- and still are -- responsible for the misery of many children.
</P>
<P>
For Nicaragua to have accepted the aid, said Paul Oquist, an adviser to Ortega,
would be comparable to the United States having accepted a donation of blood
from Japan following the attack on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. wants to help children, lift the trade embargo and stop the war,"
he said. "That would stop the production of orphans and allow more (Nicaraguan)
resources to deal with the problem ourselves."
</P>
<P>
Critics of the Sandinistas say the party's bungling management of the economy
is the real reason for its desperate straights. They accuse the Sandinistas of
torpedoing peace efforts with the Contras, suppressing the opposition press,
squelching political dissent and endlessly confounding friend and foe alike
with contradictory actions.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, representatives of U.S. and foreign relief agencies based here
and even mothers who have lost sons in the war say they supported Ortega's
action.
</P>
<P>
A summary of the immense effects of the war on children appears in a
little-publicized report prepared last summer by a team of American health
professionals sent to Nicaragua on behalf of the U.S. Agency for International
Development to assess children's needs. Among their findings, gleaned from
interviews with 40 humanitarian agencies working here and with the Nicaraguan
government:
</P>
<P>
 -- About 500,000 of the nation's 1.8 million children under age 17 have been
directly affected through destruction or disruption of schools and other
services, displacement from homes, death of parents, injuries and psychological
trauma.
</P>
<P>
 -- At least 455 children under 15 years have been killed and 691 are missing
through the end of 1987. Another 1,542 under 15 have been wounded, with an
additional 1,865 wounded among youngsters aged 15 through 20. About 1,200 have
experienced serious physical handicaps such as amputations and 568 children
have lost both parents, while 138 lost mothers and 9,371 lost fathers.
</P>
<P>
 -- As many as 50,000 children have suffered psychological trauma after seeing
their villages shot up, parents or neighbors killed and having been forced to
resettle in strange areas.
</P>
<P>
Despite the cease-fire treaty of last spring, attacks on farm cooperatives and
killing and wounding of children continue. In October, in the province of
Jinotega, a well-marked Red Cross ambulance was shot up by Contras and one
passenger was wounded. The Contras also attacked a civilian truck, killing nine
civilians, three of them women. Two children injured in the attack later died.
Four civilians were killed in an attack in another province that occurred only
hours before Hurricane Joan struck on Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
Two American physicians, Tim Takaro and Susan Cookson, who have worked for two
years in the Jinotega war zone, said $300,000 of the U.S. aid had been slated
for treating intestinal parasites in 30,000 children in their region. But
conditions imposed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, which
administers such aid funding, would have undermined the existing health system
in Nicaragua, they said.
</P>
<P>
AID requires that any private agency receiving federal funds have no connection
with the Nicaraguan Health Ministry. Yet Takaro, Cookson and other U.S. health
workers here agree that all private agencies working in health cooperate with
the government system because that is the most efficient and economical way to
get services to the people.
</P>
<P>
One of the Health Ministry's goals since the 1979 revolution has been to expand
health centers in rural areas. The policy saved many lives during the Contra
conflict. Last summer's report by the American team on the needs of children
noted with some surprise that the primary medical and social needs of most
war-injured and orphaned children had already been cared for within government
facilities. Most who required specialized care not available in Nicaragua were
sent to Eastern Bloc countries, it said. Several Health Ministry doctors said
there has been great difficulty arranging for specialized care in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The priority need now, the report said, is for continuing rehabilitation within
the children's own homes.
</P>
<P>
All U.S. federal aid to Nicaragua was suspended in 1981. Some of the slack has
been taken up by U.S. allies, including Canada, Sweden, Holland, Italy, France,
Spain and other European countries who have contributed hundreds of millions of
dollars in medical supplies and assistance. Health Ministry officials said the
severe strains on the economy have forced them to charge for certain health
services that were previously free.
</P>
<P>
Health workers have also been victims of Contra attacks. So far this year,
according to Takaro and Cookson, two volunteer Nicaraguan health workers
(brigadistas) have been killed in Jinotega province alone, eight have been
kidnaped and three are missing.
</P>
<P>
Because brigadistas live in communities where there is usually no doctor or
nurse, their services are highly valued.
</P>
<P>
"They are hard to replace when killed because others become too frightened to
volunteer," Cookson said. "Eight health centers have been attacked by Contras
in Jinotega this year. Some were destroyed and the medicine supplies were
always destroyed."
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Joan added to the general misery because of the destruction of crops,
homes, roads, bridges and service centers totaling $828 million, according to
the Social Welfare Ministry. Officials predict severe food shortages beginning
in the spring as a result of ruined bean and corn crops. The ministry has
called for $16.1 million in aid to clothe and feed for six months the 118,000
children whose lives were disrupted by the hurricane.

ISRAELI COALITION AND ARAFAT
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For once, before offering such generous but the unasked for advice, put
yourselves in Israel's place (editorial, "Israel: Starting Over," Dec. 21). The
tiny country is surrounded by vicious enemies, who not only hate the Jewish
state (as well as other non-Arab entities in the area: the Kurds, the Copts,
the Armenians, etc.) but also each other.
</P>
<P>
Who has Israel to talk to? The cowardly Jordanian monarch? Egypt, a country
rocked by pro-Khomeini unrest, whose population has never accepted peace with
Israel, and whose armed forces are being mindlessly and continuously
strengthened by Western states? Iraq, Syria, Lybia -- all of whom control the
Palestine Liberation Organization?
</P>
<P>
Why is it that The Times does not urge totalitarian Arab states and terrorist
organizations to put down their weapons, and stop all provocations? And what of
"an international peace meeting?"
</P>
<P>
Who will decide the future of Israel, who will guarantee its existence?
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, an archaic colonial empire, whose unity is cemented by tanks
and the blood of martyred White Russians, Ukrainians, Afghans, and the Balts?
The United States, whose loyalty to its allies can be eloquently witnessed to
by the late Shah of Iran, the betrayed anti-Castro Cubans of the Bay of Pigs,
the Contras, the South Vietnamese? Or maybe pro-Arab France and Greece will
guarantee Israel's right to exist?
</P>
<P>
Israel has no choice but to forge a strong coalition, maintain a unity
government, strengthen itself, and realize that in this world nobody can
guarantee anything. The best Israel will get, if it depends on such generous
advice, as The Times has given it, is a motion picture about its destruction.
We will all cry and wonder why the second Holocaust was allowed.
</P>
<P>
If the Israeli government decides to build Jewish settlements in the historic
Jewish land, then it must do so -- without waiting for advice from a slanted
and biased American media, whose news reporters eagerly write "Israeli-occupied
West Bank," but never write "Soviet-occupied Estonia," or "provocative Arab
plans for the destruction of Israel."

<TEXT>
<P>
Congratulations to Times staff writer Doug Smith and The Times for the
heartwarming and inspirational story about Kenneth and Jolene Hodder, newly
commissioned Salvation Army officers (Metro, Dec. 24).
</P>
<P>
How fortunate we are to be blessed with such unselfish and committed young
people in our efforts to cope with the myriad problems that beset our society
today.
</P>
<P>
Faith in our way of life should be immensely strengthened in knowing that
people like Kenneth and Jolene Hodder will be leading the charge for a better
tomorrow.

FIXING THE WRONG THING
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the two national political parties begin working together to make things
"better," better beware. During the last campaign, Democrats and Republicans
formed a commission to grab sponsorship of the last presidential debate away
from the League of Women Voters. The result was that the two presidential
campaigns were able to dictate ground rules that resulted not in a real debate
but in an excessively restricted and programmed question-answer session.
</P>
<P>
Now the parties have joined in a new bipartisan commission to do something
about the national political conventions. The commission has been directed to
propose ways of streamlining the conventions so that they are more appealing to
Americans on television. This is in obvious response to the poor ratings that
the conventions drew last summer and to network television's reluctance to
carry the entire proceedings. Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., the retiring Republican
national chairman, said that there had been criticism from the media that the
conventions "have become nothing more than staged activities in which nominees
give canned speeches."
</P>
<P>
The problem is that this dog is barking up the wrong tree. What needs fixing is
the pre-convention nominating process that goes on forever and produces winners
long before the delegates gather. The prospective nominees thus have control of
the convention program and arrange things so that there is a minimum of
uncertainty and controversy. This year even the names of the vice presidential
running mates were known in advance, so the conventions were robbed of any
remaining tidbit of suspense.
</P>
<P>
What the national parties must do is shorten the primary campaign and start it
someplace other than Iowa or New Hampshire. They need to be willing to have
actual issues debated on the convention floor. They need some spontaneity and
real action -- perhaps even a multiple roll-call contest for the nomination.
They do not need more programming, but less. Fix the primary process, and the
convention problem will fix itself.

VERBAL VIRUS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A brilliant hacker at Cornell University recently taught us how much damage a
computer virus can do to communications' nervous systems, but we had long known
that terminal disease has an electronic application. More troubling, perhaps
because more human, is a language virus, transmitted orally or on paper, that
spreads and replicates until meaning itself is destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The term sea-change, for example, surges through the media these days, usually
suggesting something mammoth -- as a sea-change in Soviet politics or a
sea-change in Sean Penn's police relations. The original usage was
Shakespeare's, and the bard was literally suggesting what the sea could do to a
human body. Only in 1988 did a tidal wave of sea-changes cover the land as
well.
</P>
<P>
Arguably is, arguably, the latest fad in suggesting uncertainty. The trouble is
the way it appears everywhere and may confuse -- should be argued or may be
argued -- even as it hedges.
</P>
<P>
A learned editor in this neighborhood has decided to forbid writers from having
anyone shoot himself or herself or themselves in the foot to describe
inadvertent behavior. If all the recently shot feet stood end-to-end, they
would stretch the length of the John Muir Trail.
</P>
<P>
Unique is a word that isn't. This virus has so infected the language that
particular or unusual or other simple, less assertive terms for rarity have all
but disappeared in favor of a one and only connotation -- usually false, often
in an advertisement.
</P>
<P>
Cliches are the most common strain of language virus. Gobbledygook is the
mutation most often affecting bureaucrats and politicians who would rather be
obscure than be right. The National Council of Teachers of English awarded
Public Doublespeak citations for 1988 to the agricultural spokesperson who
called pigs and cows "grain-consuming animal units," and to the safety expert
who described an aircraft crash as "uncontrolled contact with the ground."
</P>
<P>
At this point in time, our lingering wheeze from Watergate days, there is no
vaccine for verbal virus. Susceptible word-consuming human units are advised to
avoid talk shows and look out for 30-second spots.

LITTLE CHOCOLATE DOUGHNUTS TELL THE TALE OF THE U.S. TRADE CRISIS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH ROBINSON, Keith Robinson is a syndicated cartoonist in Manhattan Beach
whose book, Making It: a Survival Guide for Today, has just been published by
Harper &amp; Row.
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We hear a lot of talk that if the United States were allowed to compete on an
equal footing with foreign manufacturers, our product quality and marketing
skills would once again make us No. 1 in the world. Well, I offer for
consideration the following true story (I've protected the names of the
manufacturers involved, but any connoisseur of little chocolate doughnuts will
recognize their identities).
</P>
<P>
Brand X is recognized as the Cadillac of little chocolate doughnuts -- light,
fresh, with a chocolatey coating that is thick. Sweet. Oh-so-yummy. Most
people's first choice.
</P>
<P>
But we don't always have a choice. The micro-mini-market near me (selling
"booze 'n' munchies," according to its sign) carried only Brand Y -- heavy, dry
little chocolate doughnuts with a dark, oil-slick coating that leaves you
looking as if you've just been fingerprinted.
</P>
<P>
Still, when you wake up at the crack of noon needing little chocolate doughnuts
to get your day started, you take what you can get.
</P>
<P>
(Anyone who asks why I don't just go to the supermarket once a week and buy the
ValuePak of Brand X little chocolate doughnuts should stop reading. You've no
understanding of the American consumer and will miss the point of the story.)
</P>
<P>
One morning, overcome by the urge for little chocolate doughnuts, I walked into
the booze 'n' munchies store for a dose of Brand Y's LCDs.
</P>
<P>
With a grimace, I bit into one. WHAM! Light, fresh! Oh-so-yummy! I looked at
the package: no "New and Improved!" No "Now with even MORE Chocolatey
Goodness!" But yes -- they were good! Almost as good (dare I think it?) as
Brand X!
</P>
<P>
I could purchase Brand Y little chocolate doughnuts proudly, no longer afraid
that others were looking upon me with scorn ("Mommy! He's buying Brand Y!"
"Don't point, Junior. Some people aren't as fortunate as we are. . . ."). It
was a wonderful day!
</P>
<P>
A month later the booze 'n' munchies store was sold. The new owner was behind
the counter one morning as I bought my pack of Brand Y little chocolate
doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
"Going to start getting Brand X," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Great, although these have gotten a lot better."
</P>
<P>
He shrugged. "Well, now you'll have your choice."
</P>
<P>
You'll have your choice! Boy, that's the American way.
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, a few days later, there they were, side-by-side: Brand X and Brand
Y. What a great moment it was, being able to buy Brand X little chocolate
doughnuts, the BEST little chocolate doughnuts. Only. . . .
</P>
<P>
Something strange hit me midway through my first pack of Brand X little
chocolate doughnuts in months -- I missed Brand Y. Had I grown accustomed to
Brand Y's lower quality? Was Brand X too rich for my blood?
</P>
<P>
The next day I held a taste test, alternating a little chocolate doughnut from
Brand X with one from Brand Y. After 12 little chocolate doughnuts, I arrived
at the startling conclusion: Brand Y had surpassed Brand X in chocolatey
yumminess. I switched back to Brand Y. And I was happy. For about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
One morning I stumbled into the B 'n' M store for breakfast. No Brand Y little
chocolate doughnuts. They weren't just out -- the entire rack was gone. Little
chocolate doughnuts, cupcakes, wholesome snack pies -- everything.
</P>
<P>
"The Brand Y people refused to be in the same store with Brand X," explained
the owner. "Said if I kept selling Brand X, they'd pull out."
</P>
<P>
"But I like their little chocolate doughnuts better than Brand X's," I
protested.
</P>
<P>
He shrugged. "Love to sell both, but Brand X has the better name."
</P>
<P>
So I bought Brand X. Don't get me wrong -- they were good. But they weren't
Brand Y.
</P>
<P>
Next morning, Brand X was sold out.
</P>
<P>
"Distributor comes Thursdays," said the owner. This was Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After a little-chocolate-doughnutless weekend, I went into the store Monday.
There, where once the Brand Y rack had stood, was a rack of Brand Z products --
cupcakes, wholesome snack pies and . . . little chocolate doughnuts. I bought a
pack.
</P>
<P>
Eeyew!
</P>
<P>
Brand Z little chocolate doughnuts are not as bad as the old Brand Y little
chocolate doughnuts were, but Brand Z little chocolate doughnuts, as I'm sure
you experts will agree, simply have no taste. They're only good for the
desperate times when Brand X is sold out.
</P>
<P>
Which is usually. The booze 'n' munchies store gets its shipment of Brand X
little chocolate doughnuts every Thursday. By Friday, they're sold out.
</P>
<P>
"I tell the guy every week to bring more," shrugs the owner. "Now, the Brand Z
guys, they always make sure we're stocked."
</P>
<P>
Using the booze 'n' munchies store as our representative sample of the American
market, what have we learned?
</P>
<P>
 -- Brand X, the brand with the best reputation, ignores feedback and winds up
selling a fraction what it could.
</P>
<P>
 -- Brand Y, the brand with the best product, refuses to compete in an open
market.
</P>
<P>
 -- Brand Z, the worst of the three, is left to score the biggest sales.
</P>
<P>
Now, as I sit here munching yet another Brand Z little chocolate doughnut, I
can't help but wonder. In the huge conglomerate headquarters of Brand Z's
parent company, just what language do you suppose they're speaking?

</P>
<P>
DENIAL OF HUMANITARIAN AID CLASHES WITH OPEN HEARTS TOWARD ARMENIA
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICKEY LELAND, Rep. Mickey Leland (D-Tex.) is chairman of the House Select
Committee on Hunger.
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sight of rescue teams from around the world ignoring politics and rushing
help to victims of the earthquake in Soviet Armenia has been one of the bright
spots of a holiday season dimmed by disaster. We in the United States can take
pride in our contribution.
</P>
<P>
The instinctive response to the plight of the Armenians sent forth a signal
that the people of the world realize that we live in a global village. Leaders
of the Soviet Union abandoned their policy of secrecy and isolation while
long-time adversaries of the Soviet Union put aside past animosities.
</P>
<P>
The lesson of Armenia is that politics is not an issue when human beings have
suffered terrible loss. A notable example came from an Israeli rescue team,
some of whom had emigrated from the Soviet Union with no thought of returning.
Although the two nations have not had diplomatic relations for more than 20
years, this did not hinder the mission in Spitak and Leninakan. The team stayed
for more than two weeks, triumphing when a 15-year-old boy was pulled alive
from the debris eight days after the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, there are children much closer to us geographically than those
in Armenia who are homeless and hungry and whose parents have lost their lives
or livelihoods in a natural disaster. These children and their families have
not received aid through the government of the United States. They are the
victims of Hurricane Joan in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
While the disaster in Armenia was of much greater dimension, Hurricane Joan had
a devastating effect on Nicaragua. It left 250,000 persons homeless. Almost 3
million people lost crops or otherwise suffered economic loss. Hospitals and
schools were damaged or destroyed. A team of United Nations economists has
estimated the loss at $840 million.
</P>
<P>
Despite appeals from members of Congress and private groups such as Oxfam and
the American Friends Service Committee, the United States has refused
assistance to Nicaragua. Jamaica and Costa Rica, hit by the same storm,
received help from this country. There have been no explanations as to why
Nicaragua was counted out. Politics is the only apparent cause.
</P>
<P>
Historically, U.S. policy has been to provide disaster relief as a purely
humanitarian gesture, independent of politics. This dates back to a successful
program led by Herbert Hoover to restore Europe after World War I and has
continued through the Marshall Plan until today. In 1988 such aid went to
victims of floods in Bangladesh and the Sudan, monsoons in India and Nepal,
Typhoon Ruby in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
These actions flow from the Foreign Assistance Act, which authorizes the
President "to furnish assistance to any foreign country, international
organization, or private voluntary organization, on such terms and conditions
as he may determine, for international disaster relief and rehabilitation." The
responsibility is clearly the President's.
</P>
<P>
President Reagan, in a recent interview with David Brinkley, called Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega a "shameless dictator" who "doesn't stand in the same
box with (Soviet President Mikhail S.) Gorbachev." Has the politics of aid
reached the point of distinguishing between avowed communists when giving or
withholding humanitarian aid? Should we allow the behavior of the Sandinistas
to keep us from responding to people stricken by disaster?
</P>
<P>
While we are not in open conflict with either the Soviet Union or Nicaragua,
the recent history of national enmity makes it imperative to maintain the
principle of nonpolitical humanitarian aid to innocent civilians. To undermine
this principle erodes the internationally accepted Geneva conventions that have
enabled the Red Cross, the Red Crescent and other agencies to bring medicine
and food to noncombatants in times of war.
</P>
<P>
The only country in the world that could pose a serious, immediate threat to
the United States is the Soviet Union. Yet, we have responded generously to
innocent civilians in that country in their hour of need. Under Anastasio
Somoza, whose regime was more brutal and repressive, the United States provided
relief to Nicaraguan earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
Reporters have been told that the Nicaraguan government would not accept
assistance if it were offered. The National Assembly did reject a portion of
the Contra aid package intended for all children who had been injured by the
civil strife. In mid-November Ortega clarified that the ban was limited to the
Contra package. Shortly thereafter, the Nicaraguan charge d'affaires in
Washington said publicly that U. S. aid would be accepted through international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The new openness of the Soviet government, as it welcomes outside help and
becomes more a part of the world community, is a sign to the incoming
Administration to reverse a foreign policy that has too often put ideology
above basic human needs, above values that transcend government or party. It is
time to reaffirm the American tradition of generous response to need simply
because the need exists.
</P>
<P>
Providing humanitarian aid promotes the national interests of the United
States. We must recognize, however, that such aid makes its greatest
contribution to our credibility and our reputation in the world when it is
delivered in a nonpolitical manner.

BY GOING FOR BROKE, U.S. FOULS FARM TALKS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. SAMUELSON, Robert J. Samuelson writes about economic issues from
Washington.
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You don't need a Ph.D in economics to understand the European Community's
common agricultural policy. It sets artificially high farm prices that create
vast food surpluses. In November, for example, the world price for corn
averaged $97 a metric ton. Meanwhile, the policy promised European farmers a
minimum price of $212, a 119% premium. Naturally, European farmers produce as
much as they can. Any surpluses are then dumped onto the world market with huge
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
It's clear who's hurt. First come Europe's consumers and taxpayers. Their food
costs are too high, and 60% to 80% of the European Community's budget goes to
the policy. Next come more efficient farmers -- in the United States,
Australia, Canada, Argentina and other nations -- who lose export sales to the
Europeans. Considering all these victims, there ought to be strong pressure on
the European Community to change the policy. Think again. An intense U.S.
campaign against the policy has had almost no success.
</P>
<P>
It's a telling failure of economic diplomacy. Increasingly, the United States
can advance its economic interests abroad only with the help of other nations.
We're no longer so powerful that we can control the outcome of global
negotiations. But we're clumsy at creating the international coalitions
necessary to prevail. The farm negotiations (under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, or GATT) are a case in point. When the talks recently broke
down in Montreal, the Americans -- not the Europeans -- were mainly blamed.
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake: The talks are critical for U.S. agriculture. They may
represent the best chance for America to cut its own costly farm subsidies.
American harvests are steadily rising; last summer's drought only interrupted a
long-term trend. Without expanding exports, U.S. farmers face rising surpluses
and falling prices. The pressures for continued subsidies would be enormous.
Other food exporters confront the same dilemma. Finally, greater agricultural
exports would help some developing countries escape the debt crisis.
</P>
<P>
But somehow U.S. trade negotiators have turned a strong moral position into
political weakness. It's not that other food exporters like the agricultural
policy. They don't. Most of the European Community's minimum prices (like that
of corn) are set well above market levels. In November, the minimum price for a
metric ton of soybeans was $577, more than double the world price of $267.
Consumers pay these high prices. The Community maintains them by buying any
surpluses at the minimums. Cheaper imports are generally kept out with variable
levies that raise import prices slightly above the minimums.
</P>
<P>
The result is that farmers elsewhere lose exports to Europe and must compete
with European food surpluses -- sold at subsidized prices -- in third
countries. The policy's protection has kept high-cost farmers in business.
Efficient farmers are spurred to increase output by overusing fertilizers and
pesticides. Food production has soared. The European Community once imported
wheat; it became an exporter in the early 1970s. Since 1980, output of oil
seeds (such as soybeans) has more than quadrupled.
</P>
<P>
By all logic, the Australians, Canadians and others ought to be loudly echoing
U.S. demands that the Europeans alter the policy. But the United States has
alienated its natural allies by insisting that all countries commit themselves
-- in advance of detailed negotiations -- to the eventual elimination of most
farm subsidies. For the Europeans, this would mean signing an immediate death
warrant for the policy. That's political suicide. It was this humiliating
demand that caused the breakdown at Montreal. Other governments regard the U.S.
position as wildly unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
It's also unnecessary. The issue is not (as the U.S. position implies) all or
nothing. Suppose the policy's excessive prices are cut 60% to 80% over a
decade. That would be an immense achievement. But the talks are now stalemated
over a non-negotiable principle. The Europeans have scored a public-relations
coup and don't have to say how they'd change the policy to reduce its adverse
consequences.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural policy is not, of course, the only example of farm folly. In
addition to direct subsidies, the United States maintains import quotas on
sugar and dairy products. Japan and Korea restrict rice imports. Any trade
agreement would have to attack all these distortions. The political obstacles
are similar everywhere. Farmers have grown dependent on protection, and
governments often depend on the votes of farmers. But opening up world
agriculture is not a utopian dream. It has a big constituency -- food exporters
and, less obviously, taxpayers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
The trouble is that the United States has yet to mobilize this constituency.
Any hard negotiation is full of drama and deadlocks. The GATT talks are
scheduled to continue until 1990. They could yet succeed. But for that to
happen, the United States will have to pursue its goals more adeptly. That's
the real lesson here. Being right is not enough if, in the process, everyone
else is offended by American self-righteousness.

OUR FORCES ARE AT THE READY, BUT NOT FOR CUTBACKS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By C. A. H. TROST, Adm. C.A.H. Trost is chief of naval operations.
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As concerns about the American economy grow, the debate over defense spending
continues at a feverish pace. An entire spectrum of ideas has been placed
before the public, with critics or "defense experts" having their own agenda on
how to cut defense in an effort to reduce the nation's budgetary deficit.
</P>
<P>
The discussions of cuts that indiscriminately have an impact on defense
capabilities and current military readiness are both disconcerting and
frustrating.
</P>
<P>
The last eight years have seen some unmistakable gains in our military
readiness and capability. U.S. naval forces (in fact, all U.S. military forces)
have never been stronger or more ready. America's position in the world has
also never been so strong. Our friends, who have never feared our leadership
and have only wanted to count on our strength, can do just that. And potential
adversaries now have to recalculate their ambitions because of our strength.
</P>
<P>
Still, we see a move by various people who seem hellbent on throwing those
gains away.
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago, our political leaders -- with the support of the American
public -- committed themselves to an investment. The investment was a large
one, but was necessary to recover from the neglect of the 1970s when the
military suffered from low states of readiness. Some ships couldn't sail
because of material problems and personnel shortages; aircraft readiness was
low because of lack of spare parts and trained maintenance personnel; morale
problems abounded.
</P>
<P>
This tremendous investment provided the nation with an extremely capable fleet
and a professional personnel force that has never been more dedicated, spirited
or well-trained. Simply stated, never has the Navy been more ready to respond
to a wide range of contingencies and threats.
</P>
<P>
The question is, does the nation have the resolve to preserve its investment or
is it willing to return to the dark days of just a few years ago? To allow the
latter to happen and fail to protect the investment would be the biggest case
of fraud, waste and abuse this country has ever seen. History has repeatedly
shown us the consequences of complacency.
</P>
<P>
The critics would like to make us believe that we can't afford a strong
military. They argue that the defense buildup has caused the budget deficit.
Today, however, defense spending is less than 6% of our gross national product.
During the years of the so-called Reagan buildup, it was never more than 6.3%
-- and it has declined steadily in the last four years. But 20 years ago, that
figure was 9% -- and we had a balanced federal budget.
</P>
<P>
If one looks at a graph of defense and non-defense spending since 1969 (the
last year of a balanced budget), we see that the curve for defense is
relatively flat but that the curve for non-defense spending keeps turning
upward at an alarming rate. And the key point is that the curve almost exactly
matches the slope of our federal budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
It is frustrating for those in senior military positions -- those who are
directly responsible for providing for our nation's security and who had to
deal firsthand with our diminished capability in the last decade -- to see the
apparent complacency, the almost perverted idealism, the unscrupulous
politicking and the inability to see reason and logic in the one element of our
great democracy in which the national interest should be above parochial
interest.
</P>
<P>
It is frustrating to deal with those who argue that because we have built
something that works, we can afford to neglect it for a while. It is
frustrating to argue with those who can't stand success, who can't seem to be
comfortable with strength and who would apparently prefer being lovable losers.
</P>
<P>
Why are we turning our backs on defense? People listen to Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, probably the greatest PR man in this century, and they
think, in the immortal words of Neville Chamberlain, that we will have "peace
for our time."
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, it's not true; or at least, not yet.
</P>
<P>
It has long been a military axiom that you must not get tangled up trying to
unravel your opponent's intentions. Instead, you must keep your eyes on
capabilities. To that end, many intelligent people seem to overlook the fact
that Soviet military capabilities continue to grow while their intentions are
being slickly packaged to look like democracy in action.
</P>
<P>
Certainly something is happening in the Soviet Union today. But what it is,
what it means and how long it will last are still uncertainties. The Soviets
have not dismantled a single military system that they were not bound to do
under constraints of treaty. Except in Afghanistan, they have not withdrawn
from a single maritime or military position.
</P>
<P>
It's still a very dangerous world and the threat still threatens. We can watch
and hope. But let's keep our heads on straight.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: KUDOS TO THOSE WHO WERE NICE TO US IN '88
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER S. GREENBERG, Greenberg is a Los Angeles free-lance writer.
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that 1988 is behind us, it's a good time to acknowledge those who helped
make our travel experiences bearable, even enjoyable, last year. Some awards --
not for anyone who has been naughty, but only for those who've been nice.
</P>
<P>
Best First-Class Service: Singapore Airlines. Again this airline wins for
class, as well as style. It even wins for food, some of which is cooked to
order on board. If you like your eggs poached, they'll be poached.
</P>
<P>
Best Business-Class Service: British Airways. The airline has come a long way
from the old business class of coach seats and a few free drinks. Its new Club
Class is well recommended.
</P>
<P>
Honorable mention to Virgin Atlantic. The airline's "upper-class" service is a
well-kept secret. It's excellent, and equals, if not surpasses, other airlines'
first-class sections in terms of passenger space and other goodies, like a free
one-way coach ticket for taking just one trip.
</P>
<P>
Best Coach Service: Lufthansa. Efficient, courteous and even the meals are
thoughtful, with things like fresh fruit.
</P>
<P>
Best First-Class Seats: If you want to know the reason why Royal Jordanian
Airlines has spent upwards of $10,000 per first-class airline seat, just sit
down. These hydraulic electric marvels are truly the closest things to real
beds an airline can provide.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rivals to First Class
</P>
<P>
Best Business-Class Seats: a tie, between Cathay Pacific Airlines and British
Airways. Both airlines radically restructured their business class in 1988, and
a major part of that included removing and redesigning business-class seats,
head rests, leg rests and added leg room. And both airlines did almost too good
a job in business class. Each is now laboring to make its first class even
better, because in many cases the improved business class now rivals first
class on some other airlines.
</P>
<P>
Best Coach Seats: No award. In this category, things have actually gotten
worse, not better.
</P>
<P>
Cleanest Planes: Japan Airlines. Its flight attendants come as close to
providing perfect service as possible. Can you name another airline where the
flight attendants rush into the lavatories after each passenger has left to
clean them?
</P>
<P>
Best Domestic Airline: American Airlines. It still has a deserved reputation
for consistency of service and one of the best route structures in the United
States. It is also an airline that is rapidly expanding to Europe through new
U.S. gateways like Raleigh-Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Western Winner
</P>
<P>
Best Regional Airline: Alaska Airlines. The airline, based in Seattle, offers
great in-flight food, good on-time performance, clean airplanes and some of the
nicest, most helpful flight attendants I've ever met. In case you haven't flown
the airline, Alaska flies to 32 cities in the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Best International Airline: a three-way tie among Singapore Airlines, Thai
International and SAS.
</P>
<P>
Best Domestic Airport: a three-way tie. If you define a great airport as (1)
convenient, (2) efficient and (3) passenger-friendly, then kudos must go to the
airports in Oakland, Kansas City and Tampa. They are distinctly uncrowded, well
designed and pleasant.
</P>
<P>
Best International Airport: Schiphol, in Amsterdam. It defines the word
efficiency. And, if you like duty-free shopping, this is your place. Honorable
mention: Changi Airport in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The Humanitarian Travel Award: Doubletree Hotels. Again this year, the hotel
chain will provide free short-term lodging for those in need during this
holiday season. The chain's Room at the Inn program is offered to individuals
and families visiting loved ones in out-of-town hospitals, and runs each year
from Thanksgiving through New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
Honorable mention to Clark Howard, a retired travel agency owner. Earlier this
year, Eastern Airlines had a special promotion for its 60th birthday. The
offer: People who flew the airline 60 times in 60 days would get 60 free
tickets. Eastern never thought anyone would take them up on the offer. But
Howard did -- and won, then gave the tickets to several charities in Georgia so
that local needy children could take their first plane ride as well as enjoy a
California vacation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vacation Tips
</P>
<P>
The Safe Travel Award: Westin Maui. You can thank the hotel, or perhaps its
attorneys, for this, but thanks are due to the hotel for providing truly useful
information about the sun and surf. In a pamphlet distributed to its arriving
guests, the hotel gives specific tanning advice: "Spend a short time in the sun
during your first day or two and gradually build up during your stay." Some
swimming advice: "Enter the ocean gradually and carefully. Breakers come in
'sets' with spells of calm in between." Plus: "Never turn your back to the
ocean." If this seems like basic common sense, it is. But remember, most
visitors to Maui don't live near the water, nor do they enjoy year-round
sunshine.
</P>
<P>
The Thoughtful Hotel Award: a tie, between the Hyatt Key West Hotel and
Stouffer Hotels and Resorts. Earlier this year, when the Key West International
Airport needed a face lift, but there was no county budget for the project, the
Hyatt Key West hotel staff donated their time and repainted the terminal.
Stouffer wins for abandoning a long-standing rip-off in the hotel business. The
chain correctly identified a major traveler complaint, and dropped surcharges
on credit-card phone calls, collect calls and calls to toll-free 800 numbers.
Three cheers to Stouffer; it's about time. Honorable mention to Hyatt Hotels,
which has decided against using the more expensive alternative operator service
(AOS) to supply its long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
The Thoughtful Airline Award: UTA French Airlines. In order to welcome
Americans to France, folks who travel on a UTA Holidays trip will receive a
"telecard" good for a free four-minute call to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Freedom of Travel Award: to Japan. An agreement was just reached between
the United States and Japan exempting most Americans from needing a visa to
visit the country. Now, if we could only afford the visit!
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
And Just for Fun
</P>
<P>
There are also some unusual award winners:
</P>
<P>
The 1988 Best Travel Lawsuit Award: to the case of the sunburned buns. A court
in Madison, Wis., heard the story of the woman who stayed in the artificial sun
a little too long. The woman sued a local tanning salon, claiming she suffered
second-degree burns that ruined her vacation in Jamaica by making it impossible
to bask on the beach. She won.
</P>
<P>
And, finally, the 1988 Best Retort to a Lost Travel Lawsuit Award: to Robert
Hazard, president and chief executive officer of Quality International. The
company was sued by McDonald's after it announced its intention to use the name
"McSleep" for a chain of budget hotels. After McDonald's won the suit, Hazard
announced the new chain would be called "Jack in the Sack." Actually, the new
hotels will be called Sleep Inns.

<P>
Merry Christmas.

ONE ENCHANTED DAY WHEN PETER RABBIT STIRRED
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB O'SULLIVAN, O'Sullivan is a travel writer based in Canoga Park.
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The names Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail have never figured very large in my
adult vocabulary. Not that they weren't there. They were just too deep in
memory for easy retrieval.
</P>
<P>
Your average semi-macho guys, or even us everyday garden variety couch
potatoes, just don't tend to hang onto those memories we formed before being
checked out on two-wheel bikes. Unless we've had a refresher course.
</P>
<P>
My wife and I recently had a refresher course.
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, we were in the Lake District of Cumbria -- which is about hip
high on the British Isles -- and having a pretty good time. There aren't a
whole lot of places on this earth as pretty or as peaceful.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Lakes
</P>
<P>
We were told there are 23 lakes. Someone else said there are 19, so I suspect
the total number sort of depends on whether or not it rained recently. I do
know that however many there are, they're in one of the most awe-inspiring
settings.
</P>
<P>
Mile after mile of rolling meadows, forests and mountains, their tops
frequently lost in cloud. There are fields of wildflowers, waterfalls and about
every green that nature's got.
</P>
<P>
There are sheep -- armies of sheep, eating as fast as they can but never
catching up with the growing landscape. And there's something else . . . a
feeling that goes with the territory.
</P>
<P>
Joyce and I were talking with Paul Carlin, a friend who'd come to the Lake
District from London to manage the Borrowdale Gates Hotel near Keswick. He
grinned as we raved about the countryside, as proud as if he'd created it
himself.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visitors From All Over
</P>
<P>
"It's truly unique, you know, and I know what you mean about the feeling,"
Carlin said. "People come to the Lake District from your Wisconsin and
Minnesota, where lakes are common.
</P>
<P>
"Even from Colorado and British Columbia, whose mountains and lakes dwarf what
we have here. And they're just as enchanted as everyone else. And I think I
know the reason. It's not the lakes, you know."
</P>
<P>
"What is it?" Joyce asked.
</P>
<P>
"Well," Carlin said, "I'm almost afraid to talk about it." He leaned forward
and lowered his voice. "It may be something left over from the Druids or
Merlin's time, but I think it's magic. I really believe there is a kind of
enchantment here."
</P>
<P>
We'd almost come to that conclusion on our own. You can't drive through the
area without having that thought. We'd recently visited Dove Cottage, where
William Wordsworth lived with his family.
</P>
<P>
Though the cottage looks as if it's 300 years old, it's really kind of
commonplace. The most unusual thing about it is that the children's rooms are
wallpapered with newspapers. (The guidebook said Wordsworth thought it would
make the rooms warmer in the winter.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Setting Is Unusual
</P>
<P>
But it's not the cottage, it's the setting that makes it unusual. When you see
the view from the room where Wordsworth did his writing, you begin to
understand.
</P>
<P>
You see Lake Grasmere cupped in rolling green hills, as still and reflecting as
a mirror. The morning we were there, a few clouds were all but settling on its
surface; you could feel a bit of the magic.
</P>
<P>
There was no way a man of Wordsworth's talents could have lived in the area
without becoming what he was -- a poet laureate, the greatest poet on nature
that England has produced.
</P>
<P>
"Wordsworth? Yes," Carlin said. " 'Lucy,' 'The Solitary Reaper' and 'Daffodils'
are very nice. And you'll never convince me that James Hilton didn't spend some
time here before he wrote about Shangri-La in 'Lost Horizon,' but I was
thinking more in terms of Peter, Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail."
</P>
<P>
"Who?" I asked.
</P>
<P>
"Peter Rabbit!" Joyce exclaimed. "That's right! Beatrix Potter lived here in
the Lake Country, didn't she?"
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Almost Missed House
</P>
<P>
"That's what I meant by enchantment," Carlin said. "Her house is just down the
way. I'll jot down some directions for you."
</P>
<P>
It wasn't "just down the way" at all. It was a couple of lakes and a few dozen
turns down a long road, but the trip wasn't a chore, because the country itself
was satisfying.
</P>
<P>
We missed the house the first time and had to backtrack. We'd have missed it
again, except a small sign said, "Hill Top House," which my wife recognized
from the stories.
</P>
<P>
At first there didn't seem to be any true personality about the place. Slowly
the lady herself, Beatrix Potter, began to take form as our guide walked us
through the garden.
</P>
<P>
"It's patterned after Mr. McGregor's garden," she said. "Does that ring a
bell?"
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suddenly Interested
</P>
<P>
It meant something to most of the visitors, including Joyce, whose interest in
the garden was suddenly aroused.
</P>
<P>
"Who's McGregor?" I asked. "Refresh my memory."
</P>
<P>
No one answered. They were all listening as the guide led us into the house.
She explained how Miss Potter had lived in an era that expected all proper
young women to go from their father's house to their husband's.
</P>
<P>
Beatrix, a very average-looking young lady who spent a good part of her
growing-up years in the sparsely settled area, had been alone a lot. Having few
callers and a great deal of time, she had taken to sketching and writing
stories about the things she knew and loved, like the countryside and some of
its inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
One of them was a very young rabbit, whom she named Peter. It wasn't much of a
story. It dealt with Peter leaving his siblings -- Flopsy, Mopsy and
Cottontail, who were "good little bunnies" -- and going out and losing the new
coat his mother had made him.
</P>
<P>
He lost it when he was almost caught by Mr. McGregor, whose garden Peter had
been told never to visit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limited Edition
</P>
<P>
In 1902, probably more on the strength of the sketches than the stories, a
London publisher took a chance and brought out a limited edition of "The Tale
of Peter Rabbit."
</P>
<P>
There were no limitations from then on. Beatrix Potter wrote and illustrated
more than 25 children's books, which were published in dozens of languages, to
the delight of millions of children. And then their children and their
children's children.
</P>
<P>
"Did Beatrix Potter have children of her own?" someone asked.
</P>
<P>
"She eventually married a man named William Heelis," the guide answered, "but
she was childless."
</P>
<P>
A woman asked if Miss Potter had been able to enjoy any of her success, or
whether fame had only come after her death.
</P>
<P>
"She was a very canny lady who enjoyed huge success and made a great deal of
money."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Purchased Land
</P>
<P>
The tour group grew silent.
</P>
<P>
"In fact," said the guide, "she loved the district so, that to have some
control over what might happen to it, she began slowly buying up more and more
property in the area to keep it from being destroyed by what the world calls
'progress.'
</P>
<P>
"In addition to her writing, she spent her time working to protect all of this
part of Cumbria, to keep it pure and unspoiled for all time. Her efforts are
largely responsible for the fact that this whole district is now under the
protection of the National Trust. God willing, and thanks to Beatrix Potter, it
may be protected forever."
</P>
<P>
The tour ended and we left the house, a few feet behind a young family. As we
entered the garden again, a bird flew out of the hedge just in front of us. The
daughter of the family, a girl of perhaps 4 or 5, heard the rustling noise and
turned quickly.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thought She Saw Him
</P>
<P>
"Oh, papa," she said excitedly. The mother and father stopped and turned. The
little girl spoke excitedly to her parents in a language neither Joyce nor I
could understand. Her father answered her and then smiled at us.
</P>
<P>
"She wants to know was that Peter Rabbit who just came out of the bushes. I
told her I didn't know because I had not seen."
</P>
<P>
The little girl thought for a few seconds and then, nodding her head firmly,
spoke again. Her father translated.
</P>
<P>
"She says she thinks it was Peter Rabbit, that she thinks she caught a glimpse
of him." The little girl ran around looking under rose bushes and behind hedges
for another glimpse as we approached the gate cottage.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interesting Theory
</P>
<P>
Almost as a conspirator, the father shared a final thought with his wife and
with us. "It probably was not really Peter Rabbit, you know. That rabbit would
be 85 years old now." He winked. "Probably one of his children or his
grandchildren, huh?"
</P>
<P>
Carlin stopped by our dinner table in the hotel dining room that night and
asked if we'd made it to Hill Top House and what we thought of his theory.
</P>
<P>
"You didn't tell us what the lady had done for the district."
</P>
<P>
"Or," Joyce said, "that it was Peter Rabbit that really started it all."
</P>
<P>
"And, I'll bet," Carlin said, "that they told you Beatrix Potter never had any
children, too."
</P>
<P>
"You mean she did?" I asked.
</P>
<P>
"The way I see it, she had millions of children . . . generations of millions
of children," he said. "And didn't she leave them a lovely garden to play in?"

Letter From England
</P>
<P>
From Mary Evans of Great Britain: "I would dearly love to visit California, and
preferably not as a 'package tourist.' So I'm wondering whether any of your
readers would like to exchange a holiday with me? I'm a divorced, Irish-born
woman in my early 50s. Self-employed and had my own antique shop for some
years. Would be delighted to take my exchange visitor out to London, antique
shops, country houses and show her (or him) around. I live 45 miles from
London."
</P>
<P>
The idea is for the Californian, in turn, to host Mrs. Evans in the United
States. Her address: 97 Newport Road, Woburn Sands, Milton Keynes, England MK17
8UN.

If Harlowe wants to see the real Soviet Union she should stay away from cities
like Moscow and Leningrad. They represent their country as much as Tijuana and
Juarez represent Mexico. Moscow and Leningrad have been set up to appeal to
Western tourists. Mostly everything in these cities has been carefully
orchestrated to create a positive image. I was born and raised in Moscow, so I
am very much aware of how this system has been set up. If Harlowe wants her
eyes opened she should see towns outside of the mainstream -- if she can get
permission.

Obviously Harlowe had not stopped in other cities than Moscow and Leningrad,
for instance Smolensk, Zagorsk, Kalinin and Yaroslavl in the Russian Republic.
If you really want some fun, see what happens when you land in Lviv, Odessa,
Ternopil or Kaniv in the Ukrainian Republic. As an exchange student who
recently finished studies in the Soviet Union, I can tell you that if you
believe in glasnost, then I have a bridge to sell you.

I want to comment on the letter from Beverly Harlowe, who wrote about her
positive experience with customs in Moscow and Leningrad, "Different Customs"
(Nov. 27). As a person who is working in the Soviet Union (I am stateside on
vacation), I can tell you that what foreigners experience in Leningrad, Moscow,
Kiev and other "show" cities is not a true picture.
</P>
<P>
I work as a translator to an American delegation, so I get to travel into areas
where no American has ever set foot. Some of these areas are strategically
off-limits to foreigners. Thus, I get to see the Soviet Union as it really is.
</P>
<P>
Most of your readers have no idea what the real Soviet Union is like. They
spend two weeks in tourist cities and they become instant experts. Glasnost is
something that has been developed to appease the Western world. In reality
there has been very little change. In cities where Westerners, particularly
Americans, are accommodated, a show of glasnost is put on because the Soviets
want that image to be taken back to the United States and shared with
non-travelers.

KUDOS FOR TRAVEL AGENTS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Toni Taylor's article, "Agents Take a Beating" (Dec. 11), was the nicest thing
that could have been written about the lonely life of a travel agent and the
sometimes abuse we get from the travel industry whose livelihood really depends
on us. I entered the travel field 41 years ago, and lots of changes have taken
place in that time. But never have I read an article that was so concise and
informative about the travel agent.
</P>
<P>
Thank you for printing it. Please thank Toni Taylor for writing it. Also,
thanks for providing your readers with an informative travel section. Without
it, the public and travel agent would not be as well informed as we are now.

BLIND TWIN BROTHERS GIVE SIGHTLESS RADIO LISTENERS A DIFFERENT VIEW OF ROSE
PARADE

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While millions watch as television personalities describe the visual wonders
passing before them in Pasadena on Monday, a pair of blind radio commentators
will offer their own view of the Tournament of Roses.
</P>
<P>
John and Larry Gassman, who have never seen the parade, will broadcast live for
the third time from high in the press box.
</P>
<P>
The Whittier twins, who coincidentally will celebrate their 34th birthday
Monday, will begin their coverage of the parade at 8 a.m. on KPCC, Pasadena
City College's radio station, a program that will be carried all over the
country via satellite.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sighted Listeners, Too
</P>
<P>
Experienced broadcasters who have had their own 2-hour show on KPCC since 1980,
the men do their parade commentary especially for a blind audience.
</P>
<P>
After much preparation, including "feeling tours" of floats under construction,
they describe the parade in terms that are understandable to other sightless
people. They often refer to textures of float materials and to sizes and shapes
they have felt.
</P>
<P>
But Larry Shirk, program director of KPCC who also serves as the Gassmans'
spotter during the parade, said plenty of sighted people listen as well.
</P>
<P>
"We've had so many people say they get sick and tired of the patter on
television, and they turn down the sound on their sets and turn on the radio,"
Shirk said. He called the twins "extremely intelligent, with marvelous senses
of humor.'
</P>
<P>
Shirk said about 30 other public radio stations usually pick up the broadcast
via satellite. KPCC is at 89.3 on FM radio and is the parade's "informational"
station, Shirk said, giving weather, parking and traffic information before and
after the parade broadcast.
</P>
<P>
As on the past two New Year's Days, the twins will climb 65 feet to the
broadcasting booth before 6 a.m. Monday. While others look down on Orange Grove
and Colorado Boulevards through early morning darkness and frost, they rub
their freezing fingertips across pages of Braille notes.
</P>
<P>
Citing their biggest problem, John Gassman said, "When our fingertips freeze,
the Braille becomes fuzzy. That's like reading a printed page and the lights go
out. We tried last year to wear gloves with the fingertips cut out, but they
still froze. Now we're going to try a portable lamp with heat. Actually, it's
fun to figure out what to do."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transcribe Into Braille
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the parade, the men tape press releases that are read aloud
and then transcribe the tapes into Braille. Then they tape their observations
while they tour the floats, literally getting a feel of their sizes and
textures. In combining all of the material, they said they are prepared for
every possible delay or mishap and always have much more background information
and details than they have ever needed.
</P>
<P>
In acting as spotter, Shirk joins them in their broadcast booth to describe
anything that might occur in the parade that is not in the official lineup.
</P>
<P>
"He tells us to speed up or slow down," John said. "Anyone knows that when
you're describing a float and a band goes by, there's something wrong."
</P>
<P>
They said their style is to talk to each other during the broadcast,
questioning and answering to "keep it conversational."
</P>
<P>
"We want to be talking to people, not at them," John said. "Talking at people
is an easy trap to fall into. We try to stay away from sounding like we're
reading.
</P>
<P>
"If we use humor, it's not conscious, but if there's something funny and its in
good taste, well. . . . "
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weekly Program
</P>
<P>
They have had years of practice, anticipating each other's comments and keeping
up a lively patter.
</P>
<P>
Their weekly radio show, "Same Time, Same Station," is on KPCC every Sunday
from 6 to 8 p.m., when they replay old radio programs from their collection of
13,000 that include Jack Benny, Bob Hope, "Suspense" and "Fibber McGee and
Molly." Sometimes they interview writers or directors of the shows.
</P>
<P>
Their collection is what John called "medium-sized, but all high-quality"
recordings of the old programs. It began as a hobby and is continually growing
as the men buy and trade with other collectors all over the country.
</P>
<P>
They are identical twins who live together in their own home in Whittier, where
they grew up and attended public schools. They are graduates of Rio Hondo
College, where their interest in radio began when they began serving as hosts
of a "Top 40s" show on the college radio station in the early 1970s. They are
not employed, but hope their interest in radio, which is now a hobby, will lead
to jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Nature
</P>
<P>
They said their parents, both of whom have died, "purposely taught us that we
were just like anyone else, so being blind was just second nature."
</P>
<P>
They were born more than two months premature, and within three minutes of each
other, John weighing 1 pound, 8 ounces, and Larry 1 pound, 10 ounces. As with
many premature babies born during the 1950s, they were permanently blinded by
excessive amounts of oxygen pumped into their incubators to help keep them
alive.
</P>
<P>
"We've never been anything but blind, so we never thought about it," Larry
said. "We just learned to adapt and make the best of it. We're not negative
people anyway."
</P>
<P>
They said they have had responses to their parade commentary from people all
over the country, not all of them blind.
</P>
<P>
"No negative feedback, as far as we know," John said.

2 AGENCIES STRIVE TO TAKE OVER PEST ABATEMENT IN L.B.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what is developing into a territorial skirmish over mosquitoes, two
government agencies are swatting at each other over which of them would do a
better job of combating the city's mosquito population.
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Mosquito Abatement District, which oversees mosquito control in
the central and northeastern sections of the city, wants authority over
mosquitoes in the rest of Long Beach -- now the province of the city Department
of Health and Human Services. District officials contend the health department
is too busy fighting other public health threats, such as rats, to pay
sufficient heed to mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
Local health officials have, for their part, taken umbrage at the suggestion
that mosquitoes are running wild in their part of the city. They retort that
the abatement district is attempting to justify its mosquito grab with
error-strewn allegations that the city's equipment, pesticides and vigilance
are inferior.
</P>
<P>
The district has long wanted to bring Long Beach under one anti-mosquito
umbrella -- its own. Formed in 1952, the regional district assumed
responsibility for what was then unincorporated county land in the Long Beach
area. When the city annexed the land, the district retained mosquito
jurisdiction, leaving Long Beach divided as far as mosquitoes were concerned.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Communities Served
</P>
<P>
What's more, the city of Signal Hill, surrounded by Long Beach, is in the
district, as are the cities to the north of Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
"We do a very extensive and thorough job of mosquito control," Jack Hazelrigg,
the district's assistant manager and entomologist, said. While the city "does a
good job," Hazelrigg added, "we can do a better job."
</P>
<P>
The district's sole purpose in life is to keep mosquitoes in check, Hazelrigg
stressed. It does that in 32 cities in Los Angeles County, along with
unincorporated parts of the county.
</P>
<P>
Diana M. Bonta, recently appointed director of the Long Beach Department of
Health and Human Services, says she has no vested interest in guarding the
city's mosquito turf. Nonetheless, she says she was disheartened at some of the
district's contentions and feels compelled to correct them.
</P>
<P>
She also points out that it would cost residents slightly more if they switched
to the district, and she argues that a local, rather than a regional agency, is
more likely to be responsive to residents' complaints.
</P>
<P>
The arbiter of the matter, the City Council, has referred the district's
annexation request to its Public Safety Committee, which is holding hearings on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Undecided on Changes
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I haven't found the city to be wanting," Councilman Ray Grabinski,
the committee's chairman, said. Grabinski, whose West Long Beach district falls
under the city's jurisdiction, hastened to add that he had not decided whether
any changes were in order.
</P>
<P>
The move to bring all of Long Beach into the district was bolstered last summer
when West Long Beach residents were tormented by swarms of midges, gnat-like,
flying insects that do not bite, but do bother people. "You didn't want to open
your mouth to breathe," said Dan Cangro of the Wrigley Assn., a neighborhood
group that complained to the council that the city's bug-control efforts were
not all they might be.
</P>
<P>
"It's always been our contention that if we were under the mosquito (district)
program, we wouldn't have these problems. . . . The city has been pretty good,
but it's been on a case-by-case basis," he said, arguing that the health
department has neither the time nor the staff to devote as much attention to
mosquito control as does the district.
</P>
<P>
Bonta, pointing out that midges are largely the responsibility of county flood
control authorities, says residents are mistaken if they think the district
will eliminate the midge nuisance.
</P>
<P>
The district is funded with annual property tax assessments of a couple of
dollars on every parcel within the district. It would therefore not cost the
city anything to relinquish its mosquito duties to the district.
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, also on the Public Safety Committee,
argues that however small the fee, it will cost residents something. "I'm not
particularly receptive to turning it over to the abatement district," said
Braude, whose shoreline district is within the health department's territory.
He, too, says he is satisfied with the department's mosquito performance,
although he agrees that a case can be made for consolidating mosquito control
efforts in the city.
</P>
<P>
It costs the health department about $24,000 a year to run its mosquito
program, a sum that would likely be spent on some other city expense were it
not used on mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the Public Safety Committee last month, Bonta complained that
much of the district's information about the city's program "is simply
incorrect." For instance, she said that contrary to the district's assertions,
the department routinely sprays mosquito breeding areas and also uses
biological controls, such as mosquito fish, which consume mosquito larvae.
</P>
<P>
Bonta further argues that since it is necessary for her department to monitor
mosquito-borne diseases, the city should continue to wage some of Long Beach's
mosquito battles. It might even make sense to have the city take over the third
of Long Beach now treated by the district, she said, adding that the costs of
that move are being researched.

RESPONSE TIME OF PASADENA POLICE SHORT OF 6-MINUTE GOAL
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A city audit has concluded that police failed to respond to emergency calls
within the department goal of six minutes nearly half the time during a recent
7-month monitoring period.
</P>
<P>
A manpower shortage was cited as the reason in the audit by city administrators
and outside consultants.
</P>
<P>
The audit also concluded that the Police Department should eliminate two of its
four helicopters and consider transferring some of the officers from a special
neighborhood crime task force to other jobs.
</P>
<P>
According to the audit, officers did not meet the departmental goal of
responding within six minutes to crimes that are life-threatening or in
progress 48% of the time between July, 1987, and February, 1988.
</P>
<P>
The average delay was one second more than six minutes. Response times ranged
from 3 minutes, 16 seconds to 16 minutes, 26 seconds.
</P>
<P>
During the monitoring period, the department had about 56 officers on patrol
and was about 10 below the staffing level approved by the city.
</P>
<P>
"What I don't understand is why can't we fill those positions?" asked city
Director Kathryn Nack. "We have the money, why don't we have the people?"
</P>
<P>
Police Chief James M. Robenson said the department has had a difficult time
finding officers.
</P>
<P>
He said it is difficult to find qualified candidates since only about one in 75
is accepted. Many potential applicants prefer to work on smaller suburban
forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pasadena has tried to solve the problem by recruiting on college campuses
around the country and setting up a toll-free telephone number to provide
employment information, Robenson said.
</P>
<P>
But Robenson said the audit was wrong in assuming the shortage has affected the
department's response time to emergency calls.
</P>
<P>
He said those calls are given top priority and even if a dozen new officers
were hired, it would not significantly lower response times. More patrol
officers, he said, would have a greater impact on less serious calls, which are
sometimes delayed while police respond to emergency calls.
</P>
<P>
Robenson also said the audit was misleading because it did not count the
response time of police helicopters, which he said can reach the scene of any
crime in the city in less than a minute.
</P>
<P>
He added that even if the audit were accurate, a delay of a few seconds was
still well within an acceptable range.
</P>
<P>
"Sure I'd like to have the quickest response of any place, but we're talking
about just a few seconds," he said. "If the trend is between six and seven
minutes, I feel we're delivering at least what we should."
</P>
<P>
Police in Pomona, which is comparable to Pasadena in population, has an average
response time of 7 minutes, 50 seconds. Pomona has 94 patrol officers.
</P>
<P>
The audit, which will be presented to the Board of Directors Jan. 10, was part
of a series of reports commissioned by the city to study the operation of all
its major departments, such as water and power and public works.
</P>
<P>
The audit largely praised the Police Department for its responsiveness to the
community and innovative approach to law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
"The Pasadena Police Department can be classified as an organization on the
move," the audit stated. "Based on our analysis, the project team found no
major efficiency or effectiveness problems."
</P>
<P>
Mayor William Thomson said he was pleased with the results of the audit, saying
it confirmed his belief that "we have a first-rate department."
</P>
<P>
But Director William Paparian said the audit's conclusions led him to believe
the department has gotten away from the basics of law enforcement to pursue
"sexier" and more high-profile projects.
</P>
<P>
"We ought to be going to more substance than flash," he said. "We've gone off
on these sexy approaches and I think it's time we get back to the basics."
</P>
<P>
One example, Paparian said, was the Neighborhood Crime Task Force, a special
police unit formed to fight neighborhood crime and drug dealing, particularly
in northwest Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
The audit praised the task force for its high number of arrests and
convictions, but noted the number of felony and drug arrests have dropped.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Implications for Task Force
</P>
<P>
The audit team, which included city administrators and outside consultants,
said the smaller number of arrests for serious crimes may be the first sign the
3-year-old task force has outlived its usefulness.
</P>
<P>
The audit recommended the department consider transferring some of the task
force's 18 officers to other jobs.
</P>
<P>
But Robenson said cutting back the task force would be a "disservice" to the
northwest community, which still has the highest crime rate in the city.
</P>
<P>
While the number of felony and drug arrests did drop by about 20% during an
18-month period ending in 1987, the number of cases filed for prosecution
remained the same, the audit said.
</P>
<P>
Robenson said the task force allows the department to focus on combatting crime
in the neighborhoods by freeing up officers for foot patrols throughout the
city and undercover drug enforcement.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helicopter Unit
</P>
<P>
The audit also raised concerns about the efficiency of the department's
helicopter unit, which auditors said has more helicopters than it needs.
</P>
<P>
The unit now has four helicopters, one of which is primarily used to ferry city
officials and demonstrate the capabilities of helicopters to police officers.
Other cities of comparable size have two helicopters to accomplish the same
work, according to the audit.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why we need to have our own air force with a budget of $1.1
million," Paparian said. "I'd like to see us spend that money on
bread-and-butter stuff like more neighborhood patrols."
</P>
<P>
The audit recommended selling two of the helicopters for an annual savings of
as much as $640,000.
</P>
<P>
But Robenson said to achieve those savings the department would have to
eliminate daytime flights and cut back flight time from 3,750 hours a year to
1,170.
</P>
<P>
He said the department is spending about the same as other departments that
have just two helicopters. For example, he said, Riverside police spent $1.3
million and Newport police spent $900,000 last year to operate two helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Robenson said having four helicopters is critical to the department's patrol
strategy because they can reach the scene of a crime faster than a patrol car
and can cover much more territory.

SANTA FE SPRINGS FIRMS CREATE AID NETWORK UNDER EMERGENCY PLAN
</P>

SANTA FE SPRINGS
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the dust from the Whittier Narrows earthquake on Oct. 1, 1987, finally
settled, city officials began hearing from concerned business owners.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake knocked out telephone service, preventing the city's 3,500
businesses from reporting emergencies such as fires and medical problems. The
nearly 80,000 workers who commute to Santa Fe Springs daily clogged streets for
hours. At one point it took nearly 2 hours for a city fire truck to travel
about 3 miles from the fire station to City Hall, said Fire Chief Robert
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
"Communications were terrible," Wilson said. "We were overwhelmed. We really
had no idea what was going on in the city."
</P>
<P>
The safety and satisfaction of the business community is especially important
in Santa Fe Springs, where 85% of the land is zoned for commercial use.
</P>
<P>
"In the daytime, we could have major problems just dealing with the numbers of
people" who work here, said Assistant City Manager Fred Latham. "And if this
were to occur at night, we could have unoccupied buildings with substantial
damage and not be aware of it."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Partnership Formed
</P>
<P>
As a result of these concerns, the public and private sectors in Santa Fe
Springs have formed a partnership to design an emergency-preparedness plan that
would reduce the burden on city government in the three days after a disaster.
</P>
<P>
The Santa Fe Springs Chamber of Commerce suggested that businesses establish
their own emergency communications network. City officials agreed, and in the
past year the chamber's suggestion has evolved into an elaborate plan. Though
supervised by the city, businesses will turn to one another instead of the city
when disaster strikes.
</P>
<P>
With just 15,000 residents concentrated in a 2-square-mile area, the best
option for Santa Fe Springs is to rely on businesses in the other seven square
miles of town to provide their own emergency support, said Tony Ferrara, a
supervisor at the California Specialized Training Institute. The institute is a
division of the state Office of Emergency Services which is helping a committee
of city and chamber officials prepare the plan.
</P>
<P>
"The city told the businesses, 'We don't have the traditional support systems.
So you are it,' " Ferrara said. "This was a tremendous buy-in on the part of
industry . . . and the city was willing to depart from the norm as far as their
association with the private sector. What they are doing is making use of what
they have, and what they have is industry."
</P>
<P>
If an earthquake were to happen once the city's plan is in place, this is how
businesses would respond:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Command Posts
</P>
<P>
They would immediately report to one of four command posts, where an area
coordinator would report any emergencies to city officials by radio. Workers on
foot or riding bicycles would check neighboring businesses for injured
employees or other problems.
</P>
<P>
Once damages are assessed, workers would turn to a handbook to see where
emergency supplies are available. Under the cooperative plan, a food warehouse
might agree to donate food and another firm might provide blankets or plywood
for boarding up broken windows.
</P>
<P>
"We are asking businesses to go beyond their own walls and hold hands," Latham
said. "It's really exciting."
</P>
<P>
Once post-disaster emergencies have been taken care of, the plan calls for
businesses to resume operations quickly. For example, a business using propane
might not be able to reach a supplier in Los Angeles, so the plan would include
a list of propane suppliers in the immediate area.
</P>
<P>
"An important element is getting the businesses running again," Wilson said.
"They're producing resources that can be used for the recovery effort."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disaster Assistance
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for familiarizing business owners with government disaster
assistance loans and grants.
</P>
<P>
Rick Landis, president of the Santa Fe Springs Chamber of Commerce, said the
plan has met with an enthusiastic reception from the business community.
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of resources in this city, and most businesses are willing to
share them," Landis said. "We're going to wind up with a business community
that is really well prepared. . . . We feel we are on the cutting edge of
emergency preparedness."
</P>
<P>
It will be about three years before the system is completely in place, Latham
said. Next month, the chamber plans to mail questionnaires to all Santa Fe
Springs businesses, requesting their participation and outlining information
about operating hours, existing emergency plans and other relevant facts, he
said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1989, organizers plan to have the handbook distributed and
command posts set up. In 1990, they plan to complete training in disaster loan
procedures, first aid and other emergency measures. Santa Fe Springs will
assign one Fire Department employee to supervise the effort, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
The City Council, impressed by the efforts of the business community, has asked
city staff to develop a similar emergency response system for residential
areas, Latham said.
</P>
<P>
Ferrara hopes that Santa Fe Springs' business network can become a model for
other cities and counties with large industrial bases.
</P>
<P>
"The concept is that over a period of time, there will be a network of
communication and support," Latham said, "so when an emergency does occur, the
relationships will automatically be in place."

REVIEWING THE 'CITY HALL CIRCUS'
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bravo to The Times for printing the facts objectively about the mess in Long
Beach resulting from unrestrained and unplanned development!
</P>
<P>
Mayor Kell is typically being demagogic when he says there is "plenty of blame
to go around" for the mushrooming apartment houses where single-family
dwellings stood a few months ago. He and three other members of the City
Council alone approved this sellout. What Kell really means is there is plenty
of blame to try to spread around, which he is, of course, trying to do.
</P>
<P>
Yet even Kell is exceeded in artful dodging by Councilwoman Jan Hall, who
managed to lead both the city of Long Beach and the RTD into disaster
simultaneously and then duck responsibility for both.
</P>
<P>
Not mentioned in your coverage was the incredible ineptitude displayed by Kell,
Hall and company, in the matter of the airport and the Pandora's box of noise
and pollution that has opened up. While other cities have been going in the
direction of placing airports away from city centers and population, our
council, of course, is going in precisely the opposite direction and trying to
expand one in a prime residential section of our city!
</P>
<P>
One who has followed the City Hall circus would, of course, expect a "solution"
from Kell and Hall for the parking problem they have created; they want to
harass a tiny, politically unprotected minority of small boat owners who cause
probably less than one-tenth of 1% of the problem ("Long Beach Thinks Again
About Paving of Greenbelt," Times, Dec. 4). Thus they can continue to flail
around while giving the superficial impression of doing something.
</P>
<P>
Finally, to call the Long Beach Planning Department ineffectual is to be unduly
charitable. They have proven themselves to be the Keystone Kops of urban
planning.
</P>
<P>
One fears the inmates are running the asylum. Please keep your spotlight
focused; it may perchance do some good.

SIGHTLESS TWINS GIVE LISTENERS A DIFFERENT VIEW OF ROSE PARADE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY BARBER, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While millions watch as television personalities describe the visual wonders
passing before them in Pasadena on Monday, a pair of blind radio commentators
will offer their own view of the Tournament of Roses.
</P>
<P>
John and Larry Gassman, who have never seen the parade, will broadcast live for
the third time from high in the press box.
</P>
<P>
The Whittier twins, who coincidentally will celebrate their 34th birthday
Monday, will begin their coverage of the parade at 8 a.m. on KPCC, Pasadena
City College's radio station, a program that will be carried all over the
country via satellite.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sighted Listeners, Too
</P>
<P>
Experienced broadcasters who have had their own 2-hour show on KPCC since 1980,
the men do their parade commentary especially for a blind audience.
</P>
<P>
After much preparation, including "feeling tours" of floats under construction,
they describe the parade in terms that are understandable to other sightless
people. They often refer to textures of float materials and to sizes and shapes
they have felt.
</P>
<P>
But Larry Shirk, program director of KPCC who also serves as the Gassmans'
spotter during the parade, said plenty of sighted people listen as well.
</P>
<P>
"We've had so many people say they get sick and tired of the patter on
television, and they turn down the sound on their sets and turn on the radio,"
Shirk said. He called the twins "extremely intelligent, with marvelous senses
of humor.'
</P>
<P>
Shirk said about 30 other public radio stations usually pick up the broadcast
via satellite. KPCC is at 89.3 on FM radio and is the parade's "informational"
station, Shirk said, giving weather, parking and traffic information before and
after the parade broadcast.
</P>
<P>
As on the past two New Year's Days, the twins will climb 65 feet to the
broadcasting booth before 6 a.m. Monday. While others look down on Orange Grove
and Colorado Boulevards through early morning darkness and frost, they rub
their freezing fingertips across pages of Braille notes.
</P>
<P>
Citing their biggest problem, John Gassman said, "When our fingertips freeze,
the Braille becomes fuzzy. That's like reading a printed page and the lights go
out. We tried last year to wear gloves with the fingertips cut out, but they
still froze. Now we're going to try a portable lamp with heat. Actually, it's
fun to figure out what to do."
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the parade, the men tape press releases that are read aloud
and then transcribe the tapes into Braille. Then they tape their observations
while they tour the floats, literally getting a feel of their sizes and
textures. In combining all of the material, they said they are prepared for
every possible delay or mishap and always have much more background information
and details than they have ever needed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acting as Spotter
</P>
<P>
In acting as spotter, Shirk joins them in their broadcast booth to describe
anything that might occur in the parade that is not in the official lineup.
</P>
<P>
"He tells us to speed up or slow down," John said. "Anyone knows that when
you're describing a float and a band goes by, there's something wrong."
</P>
<P>
They said their style is to talk to each other during the broadcast,
questioning and answering to "keep it conversational."
</P>
<P>
"We want to be talking to people, not at them," John said. "Talking at people
is an easy trap to fall into. We try to stay away from sounding like we're
reading.
</P>
<P>
"If we use humor, it's not conscious, but if there's something funny and its in
good taste, well. . . . "
</P>
<P>
They have had years of practice, anticipating each other's comments and keeping
up a lively patter.
</P>
<P>
Their weekly radio show, "Same Time, Same Station," is on KPCC every Sunday
from 6 to 8 p.m., when they replay old radio programs from their collection of
13,000 that include Jack Benny, Bob Hope, "Suspense" and "Fibber McGee and
Molly." Sometimes they interview writers or directors of the shows.
</P>
<P>
Their collection is what John called "medium-sized, but all high-quality"
recordings of the old programs. It began as a hobby and is continually growing
as the men buy and trade with other collectors all over the country.
</P>
<P>
They are identical twins who live together in their own home in Whittier, where
they grew up and attended public schools. They are graduates of Rio Hondo
College, where their interest in radio began when they began serving as hosts
of a "Top 40s" show on the college radio station in the early 1970s. They are
not employed, but hope their interest in radio, which is now a hobby, will lead
to jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Nature
</P>
<P>
They said their parents, both of whom have died, "purposely taught us that we
were just like anyone else, so being blind was just second nature."
</P>
<P>
They were born more than two months premature, and within three minutes of each
other, John weighing 1 pound, 8 ounces, and Larry 1 pound, 10 ounces. As with
many premature babies born during the 1950s, they were permanently blinded by
excessive amounts of oxygen pumped into their incubators to help keep them
alive.
</P>
<P>
"We've never been anything but blind, so we never thought about it," Larry
said. "We just learned to adapt and make the best of it. We're not negative
people anyway."
</P>
<P>
They said they have had responses to their parade commentary from people all
over the country, not all of them blind.
</P>
<P>
"No negative feedback, as far as we know," John said.

LONG BEACH URGED TO HELP HOMELESS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe for the New Year . . . the Long Beach city administration might . . .
officially help the homeless in the Long Beach area.
</P>
<P>
As an article in the Long Beach section showed (Times, Dec. 22), local
restaurants, such as Vincent Williams' Golden Bird chicken outlets, donate food
to the Long Beach Family Shelter for the Homeless.
</P>
<P>
Other restaurants such as Justina's in downtown Long Beach, Domino's Pizza and
Twin Wheels Steak House have jumped on the bandwagon in giving food to the Long
Beach Family Shelter for the Homeless.
</P>
<P>
So when will the Long Beach City Council . . . jump on the bandwagon and take
official action to help the homeless as recommended by the city's task force in
1987? Will they do something in early 1989?

SUPER QUIZ DROPS 'CRUSOE' AFTER RACISM COMPLAINT
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Robinson Crusoe" has been thrown overboard by the planners of the Los Angeles
Unified School District's Sixth Annual Academic Pentathlon after a teacher
complained about racial stereotyping in the literary classic.
</P>
<P>
In October the district notified coaches preparing middle-school students for
the districtwide academic competition that the Super Quiz would deal with
Daniel Defoe's 18th-Century novel about shipwreck and survival. A few weeks
later, the coaches were sent a memo saying the book had been withdrawn and
replaced by Jules Verne's classic "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea." No reason was
given for the change.
</P>
<P>
According to Lorna Round, the district's associate superintendent of
instruction, the Defoe book was dropped from the pentathlon after a coach in a
predominantly black school objected to "the blatantly racist attitude pervasive
throughout the book." Round declined to identify the coach, who is on winter
break, without first obtaining his permission.
</P>
<P>
Round said the coach had objected to passages such as the following description
of Friday, the black man who ends Crusoe's decades of isolation: "He was a
comely handsome fellow perfectly well made. . . . His hair was long and black,
not curled like wool. . . . The color of his skin was not quite black . . . and
yet not of an ugly yellow, nauseous tawny as the Brazilians . . . his nose
small, not flat like the Negroes."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Pulled From Shelves
</P>
<P>
Round said the staff agreed with the coach's contention that "a book which
reinforces negative racial stereotypes should not be the centerpiece of a
districtwide competition." Round emphasized that the book had not been pulled
from library shelves nor censored in any other way, only dropped from the list
of material to be used in the competition. The pentathlon will be held Feb. 25
at Fairfax High School.
</P>
<P>
"We're not saying 'Don't read it,' " Round said. However, she said she and
other staff members felt that, given the uncomplimentary characterization of
blacks and other minorities in the book, it needed to be taught carefully. A
specific concern, she said, was that the book's treatment of minorities might
negatively affect the self-esteem of some minority students.
</P>
<P>
Given the deadline imposed by the competition, she said, "we didn't feel we had
time to talk to all the teachers (about ways the book might be constructively
taught)." Round said the district hoped to develop a lesson plan for the book
that would address the troublesome issues it raises.
</P>
<P>
A few coaches called the district to protest the change in books, Round said.
Most were distressed because they had already begun working with their students
on "Robinson Crusoe."
</P>
<P>
Both books are recommended for study by middle-school students by the state
Department of Education. Janet R. Cole, a state education official, lauded the
district for its handling of the matter. "I think it's wonderful that they are
sensitive to the community. Both are excellent books. It doesn't matter which
one they use."

SHOP OWNERS ARE PIONEERS IN REVIVING OLD WEST STYLE;
</P>
<P>
MONTEREY FURNITURE RIDES BACK OUT OF SUNSET
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That low-slung, wooden couch with cushions covered in Mexican serapes is not
cheesy: It's Monterey, Jack.
</P>
<P>
What? You don't remember the style of furniture that filled working-class Los
Angeles ranch houses in the 1930s and '40s, spread East with the lore of
Westerns, then met an inglorious end in the rumpus room?
</P>
<P>
Don't blame Don Shorts and Dolores Fisher. The proprietors of a Ventura
antiques shop, they take credit for rekindling interest in Monterey furniture,
which is decorated with wrought-iron hinges, hand-painted donkeys, flowers and
sombrero-bedecked figures.
</P>
<P>
"We like to be considered the pioneers in bringing this thing back to light,"
explained Shorts, 54, who co-owns the Old California Store on East Thompson
Boulevard with Fisher, 55.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cowboy Style
</P>
<P>
Others may have received more publicity for selling the factory-made furniture
that Ojai collector Bob Smith describes as "a motion-picture version of what
cowboys might have had in the way of furniture -- if they had furniture."
</P>
<P>
But none of the handful of Monterey dealers has done more to research and
promote a style whose history was little known 6 months ago, the couple's
colleagues agree.
</P>
<P>
"I would certainly give the most credit for the resurrection to Don and Dee,"
said Jack Moore, a Pasadena antiques dealer who for 7 years has traded in the
furniture that combines early California, Mexican and Western influences.
</P>
<P>
Shorts and Fisher have turned their 1926 home, which doubles as living quarters
and a showroom, into a Monterey monument, with a rotating selection of dining
room sets, bedroom sets, living room groupings, Mexican kitsch and at least
three photographs of Will Rogers.
</P>
<P>
They also publish a newsletter on the furniture, serve as hosts at "openings"
in the homes of clients, and organize outings to such shrines of Monterey
furniture as Rogers' 1921 ranch house in Pacific Palisades.
</P>
<P>
The couple even organized a museum exhibition last summer of the ersatz cowboy
furniture. "Monterey: An Exhibition of California Rancho Furniture, Pottery and
Art" filled one story and part of a second at the Santa Monica Heritage Museum.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Introduction
</P>
<P>
The exhibition enhanced the furniture's status as a collectible by popularizing
it, antiques dealers say. It also introduced the style to Kenneth Trapp, a
curator of decorative arts at the Oakland Museum. Now he plans to include it in
an upcoming exhibition of California Craftsman furniture.
</P>
<P>
"It struck me as wonderfully ludicrous," Trapp said.
</P>
<P>
And so it is. Consider the chaise lounge done up frontier-style, with a canvas
canopy to complete the covered-wagon look. Or the grand piano fashioned out of
wood so rough-hewn that it looks as if it had been dragged through a mountain
pass.
</P>
<P>
In the last 2 years, the Westward-ho look has become Westward-haute. Magazines
such as Metropolitan Home and Better Homes and Gardens have praised Monterey
furniture, tony Los Angeles shops have taken to selling it, and one shop even
peddles modern-day reproductions of it.
</P>
<P>
The limelight also has fallen on the designer of the Monterey line, George
Mason, an 81-year-old retiree now living in San Luis Obispo. Instead of making
couches and chairs, these days Mason occupies himself with painting, and lately
his favorite subject has been his own rediscovered furniture.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paintings Exhibited
</P>
<P>
Earlier in December, Shorts and Fisher mounted an exhibition of the folksy
paintings at their store. Mason's painted renditions of Monterey furniture sold
briskly for as much as $185 apiece, while about 50 collectors competed for his
attention.
</P>
<P>
"I came down from Pismo Beach just to shake his hand," gushed Patricia Slater,
53, a designer of what she described as "cowboy punk" furniture.
</P>
<P>
It almost seemed like the good old days to Mason, whose father ran the Los
Angeles factory where his designs were made. In 1929, executives of Barker
Brothers Furniture asked the pair to design and manufacture a line that would
bear the Monterey name and would suit the ranch houses springing up all over
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
The Masons were told to take their cue from a settee that appeared in the
background of a Warner Brothers movie, "Old Arizona."
</P>
<P>
Made from Oregon alder, stained in six colors and shaped into about 120 pieces,
each quirkier than the last one, the furniture was a hit, as were a host of
copycat lines: La Fiesta, Coronado, Ranch-O.
</P>
<P>
Monterey-style furniture spread to homes in Texas, New York, Chicago and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changing Times
</P>
<P>
In 1943, Mason was drafted; his father died, and Monterey came to a grinding
halt. After the war, tastes changed.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone threw it out and got chrome and glass," said Betty Gold, who stocked
her much-publicized Melrose Avenue furniture shop, Territory, with Monterey
purchased from Shorts and Fisher.
</P>
<P>
The distinctive furniture became, as one collector says, "grist for garage
sales."
</P>
<P>
Enter Shorts, who 10 years ago quit his job as a high school history teacher in
Santa Barbara to devote himself full-time to his hobby of collecting old
paintings and furnishings.
</P>
<P>
The homemade crafts and pottery that sold at roadside stands throughout
Southern California in the 1930s had begun to attract his attention. Typically
decorated with sombrero-topped men either asleep beneath cactuses or leading
stubborn mules, they reminded him of his South Gate childhood.
</P>
<P>
"I was a '30s Southern California child and have never outgrown it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shorts discovered Monterey furniture and liked how well it matched the
knickknacks he was acquiring.
</P>
<P>
He bought the furniture first for himself, because he did not think it would
sell. In fact, it was not until 2 years ago that the shop began to deal
exclusively in Monterey-style furniture and its trappings. Since then, sales
have tripled, he said, and he delves into a network of thrift shops and
secondhand stores to replenish his stock.
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, Shorts was not sure until recently what he was selling. He
had noticed that the pieces were all branded with the same label -- "Monterey"
-- but unraveling their origins proved difficult.
</P>
<P>
One person told him that the furniture came from Monterrey, Mexico. No, another
said, Monterey, Calif. But a Monterey, Calif., antiques dealer put that notion
to rest. "Oh, that's what we call Carmel furniture," she told him.
</P>
<P>
It was not until a friend found an old Barker Brothers catalogue that Shorts
had a tangible lead. Lacking details, however, Shorts wrongly concluded that
the company had manufactured the furniture, not merely sold it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Error Noted
</P>
<P>
Mason, the furniture's real manufacturer, noted the error when he read an
article about the Santa Monica exhibition. "It made me so angry," remembers
Mason, who complained to the museum's director, Tobi Smith. She was only too
happy to hear from him.
</P>
<P>
Smith enlisted both Mason and Shorts to write chapters in an upcoming catalogue
of the exhibition, which will include an essay by Smith's husband, Bob, the
Ojai collector, who also teaches furniture design at Cal State Northridge.
</P>
<P>
Titled "My Mexicana Nirvana," Bob Smith's piece hails the furniture as "a
unique manifestation of Western urban culture."
</P>
<P>
"Woven with mythology, fantasy, eclecticism and pretension, Monterey furniture
is synonymous with Southern Californians' collective search for a meaningful
identity -- a population with no heritage and little in common," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
Bob Smith believes that modern furniture buyers are attracted to Monterey
because it tickles the modern fancy.
</P>
<P>
"As an unabashedly eclectic and nostalgic movement, Postmodernism says it's all
right to borrow style or fake material if you are honest about it," he said.
And "Monterey Furniture is honestly fake."
</P>
<P>
Even honestly fake furniture comes with a price. A dining room set sells for
$3,500 at the California shop, which is still less expensive than a fine chair
from the Arts and Crafts Movement but is much more than the $79 Mason remembers
the same pieces selling for originally.
</P>
<P>
But for collectors, such as Alan Erenberg, 39, the cost is worth it. He says
the furniture perfectly fits the hacienda-inspired architecture so prevalent in
Southern California. A vice president of Serta, the mattress company, he and
his former wife, Lori, replaced their collection of '50s furnishings with
Monterey when they bought a 1920s California ranch house. When they recently
divorced, he said he "got custody" of the furniture, which now decorates his
Spanish Revival apartment in Venice.
</P>
<P>
That does not mean, however, that everybody loves Monterey.
</P>
<P>
Some of Gloria List's clients at Nonesuch Gallery in Santa Monica "find it
garish and klutzy," she said. And even converts can tire of Monterey's quirky
style. Two of Shorts' best customers, he sadly reports, recently tossed out
their Monterey collection in favor of crisp, contemporary furnishings.
</P>
<P>
But Mason is glad that at least some see the world through his eyes. After
returning from military service, he longed for the Monterey days. First he
represented another furniture company; then he ran a store that sold Colonial
furniture.
</P>
<P>
"I was an unhappy guy," he said.

STATE DROPS THREAT TO FINE WHITTIER ON WASTE MISHAP
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WHITTIER
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state has dropped its threat to fine the city up to $30,000 in connection
with a June mishap at a household toxic-waste roundup after city officials
warned that they would refuse to hold more roundups.
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Health Services cited Whittier for failing to report to
the state that a contractor hired to manage the roundup created a small toxic
cloud by mixing several types of acids together. By law, the state should have
been notified within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
Jim Marxen, a spokesman for the Department of Health Services, said the state
decided against the fine because it might scare off other cities conducting
toxic-waste roundups. In such roundups residents dispose of household chemicals
such as paint thinners and insecticides. About 400 households participated in
Whittier's roundup.
</P>
<P>
"We're not after the money," Marxen said. "What we're after is having them
comply with the law and understand that they have violated the law. . . . The
public airing of their fault was felt to be enough of a punishment."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City's Position
</P>
<P>
Michael Woods, an attorney who handled the case for Whittier, said the city was
"not simply going to roll over" and take the fine. The city's position has been
that any fine as a result of the accident should be paid by the contractor,
Omega Recovery Services, which was paid $60,000 for the job, Woods said.
</P>
<P>
City officials also told the state that if Whittier were fined, the city would
refuse to conduct any more toxic roundups, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the city was going to end up getting slapped with a fine for its
responsible effort (to hold the roundup), then why take that risk?" Woods
asked.
</P>
<P>
In an out-of-court settlement of the issue, city officials agreed to:
</P>
<P>
Make presentations to other cities in the Los Angeles area about the correct
way to run a household toxic-waste roundup;
</P>
<P>
Provide extra training over the next eight months to city employees involved in
handling hazardous wastes.
</P>
<P>
Send the state within 60 days a detailed plan for any future hazardous-waste
roundups.
</P>
<P>
Request state approval at least 60 days before any future roundup. The state
normally requires only 30-days' notice from agencies who want to organize such
events.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Going to Be Watching'
</P>
<P>
"This is just as serious as when we were talking about the fine," Marxen, the
health services spokesman, said of the agreement. "We're going to be watching
(Whittier officials) pretty closely in the future because of their track
record."
</P>
<P>
During the roundup, Dennis O'Meara of Omega Recovery Services mixed several
types of potent nitric acid in a 55-gallon drum. O'Meara, who was not wearing
the proper protective clothing, was treated at a hospital after his face and
arms were burned.
</P>
<P>
After the citation was reported in news accounts, the city fired Tom Bayles,
the assistant public services director responsible for hazardous waste

The USO has received a city permit to move its administrative offices and
social club into the restored Masonic Temple on Pine Avenue in downtown Long
Beach, close to the 16,000 military personnel who live in the area.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the United Service Organizations of Los Angeles say the Pine
Avenue club will open this spring. It will provide a lounge and game room for
servicemen. In addition, it will offer a variety of services to military
families, such as housing and child-care referrals.
</P>
<P>
Long Beach, with its sizable military population, is now a much more suitable
site for the club than Hollywood, USO officials said.

President Francois Mitterrand stressed France's role in a unified Europe by
delivering a New Year's Eve speech from Strasbourg, headquarters of the
European Parliament. It was the first time a French head of state had made the
traditional address to the nation from outside Paris. Mitterrand urged France's
11 European Community partners to make 1989 a year of growth, saying: "Only a
Europe united in technological, economic and monetary terms can rival Japan and
the United States. Only a politically united Europe can hold up its head before
the powers that dominate the world."

Twenty-seven people in Plymouth, Mass., were arrested on trespassing charges as
125 activists demonstrated against the restart of the Pilgrim nuclear power
plant, shut down since April, 1986, when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
branded it "one of the worst-run" nuclear plants in the country. Last week the
plant started low-power testing, and it should be at full power in four months.
The state has vowed to do everything possible to keep the plant from operating.
Last month, Massachusetts voters rejected a referendum question that would have
permanently closed Pilgrim and the Yankee plant in Rowe.

THE RAILEY CASE;
</P>
<P>
THE BRUTAL ATTACK ON THE POPULAR PASTOR'S WIFE AND HIS SUICIDE ATTEMPT BECAME
DALLAS' MOST HAUNTING AND SENSATIONAL MYSTERY IN A DECADE
</P>
</HEADLINE>

DALLAS
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bewildered friends and followers would recall that he looked tired and
depressed, still grief-stricken and mystified over the savage assault on his
wife.
</P>
<P>
Little more than a week had passed since he found her comatose on the garage
floor, choked senseless and left for dead. She had not regained consciousness.
</P>
<P>
Now, in the early evening hours of April 30, 1987, the intense, balding man
excused himself and disappeared into a private hospital suite.
</P>
<P>
He locked and chained the door, sat down with pen and paper and began composing
a chilling letter.
</P>
<P>
"There is a demon inside my soul," he wrote. "It has always been there. My
demon tries to lead me down paths I do not want to follow. At times that demon
has lured me into doing things I do not want to do.
</P>
<P>
". . . My demon has finally gotten the upper hand."
</P>
<P>
When security officers broke in the next morning, they found him sprawled
across the bed. He was alive but unconscious and in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
Nearby were empty bottles of prescription drugs and his rambling letter, which
began with instructions for his funeral and ended thusly:
</P>
<P>
"I have finally made the decision to take care of myself. I have grown weak.
God has remained strong. Therein lies your hope. I have none.
</P>
<P>
"Walker L. Railey."
</P>
<P>
The vicious attack on Walker Railey's wife and his ensuing suicide attempt
devastated three families, split a church and outraged a city.
</P>
<P>
For Peggy Railey was by no means an ordinary homemaker, and her husband was
perhaps Dallas' most dynamic and socially conscious young minister. At 39,
Walker Railey reigned as the senior pastor of the city's 6,000-member First
United Methodist Church and loomed as a rising star in his mainstream
Protestant denomination.
</P>
<P>
The news of the suicide attempt swept through town, nowhere more devastatingly
than at First Methodist, where Railey's flock was already reeling from the
attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Keep Him in Our Prayers'
</P>
<P>
His chief assistant, the Rev. Gordon Casad, told the congregation the next
Sunday, "We must remember our pastor and the troubling of his mind and spirit
and keep him in our prayers."
</P>
<P>
Asked if Railey was now a suspect, Park Stearns, supervisor in the Dallas FBI
office, replied: "This is a big no comment."
</P>
<P>
Although police refused to reveal the contents of Railey's letter, they
described it as an apparent suicide note. And they redoubled their efforts to
review with the convalescing minister what happened the night his wife was
attacked.
</P>
<P>
A fellow pastor, the Rev. David Shawyer of Plymouth Park Methodist Church,
said, "I'm praying that it is not what it looks like. I'm praying that what the
police are suggesting could never be true.
</P>
<P>
"I'm praying this will all come out some other way."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latest Twist in Mystery
</P>
<P>
Railey's attempt on his own life was only the latest twist in what would be
called Dallas' most haunting and sensational mystery in a decade. One
unrestrained commentator called the attempted murder the city's most
extraordinary crime since the assassination of President Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
Peggy Railey survived, but only barely so. Comatose, she could not identify her
assailant.
</P>
<P>
Several anonymous, typewritten death threats preceded the attack, apparently
provoked by Railey's strong sermons and public statements against racial
prejudice and injustice. But friends said Peggy Railey did not frighten easily,
and she had encouraged her husband not to soften his stand.
</P>
<P>
The last letter was slipped under the door of a church office just prior to
Easter Sunday services. It said: "EASTER IS WHEN CHRIST AROSE, BUT YOU ARE
GOING DOWN."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wore Bulletproof Vest
</P>
<P>
Under the stern scrutiny of security officers, Railey delivered his Easter
sermon wearing a bulletproof vest beneath his robes.
</P>
<P>
It would be his last appearance in the pulpit of First Methodist's historic old
sanctuary. He hammered the congregation with a theme of death and resurrection
that morning.
</P>
<P>
"You're going to die," he said, pointing his finger at parishioners.
</P>
<P>
"You're going to die," he repeated.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to die."
</P>
<P>
Police and church officials first theorized that the attempt on Peggy Railey's
life was some kind of grotesque retaliation for her husband's outspokenness.
</P>
<P>
With his wife in critical condition, Railey stationed himself outside her
hospital room, interrupting his vigil only for a trip downtown to give
investigators an account of his activities the night of April 21.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Noticed Open Garage Door
</P>
<P>
He said he'd spent the evening doing research at Southern Methodist University
libraries. Returning home about 12:40 a.m., he said, he noticed that a door to
the darkened two-car garage was partly open.
</P>
<P>
Driving inside with his headlights on, he found his wife lying on the floor,
writhing in convulsions. Her face was puffy and discolored and she was frothing
at the mouth.
</P>
<P>
He said the children, Ryan, 5, and Megan, 2, were inside the house and
unharmed.
</P>
<P>
After the interview, Capt. John Holt, 37, the tall, sandy-haired supervisor of
crimes against persons, told reporters the questioning was routine.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any indicators that would point to him as a suspect," he said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arranged for Hospital Suite
</P>
<P>
Railey returned to the hospital to arrange for a suite near his wife. He spent
the day greeting a parade of visitors who expressed shock, sorrow and support.
</P>
<P>
Among those who came to share their grief that day was a striking frosted
blonde who carried a single red rose and disappeared into Railey's hospital
suite.
</P>
<P>
With the investigation in full swing and the FBI trying to identify the source
of the death threats, Railey continued his hospital vigil under heavy police
protection.
</P>
<P>
"He's just numb. . . . He's overwhelmed by it," said Ralph Shannon, a longtime
church member.
</P>
<P>
If Railey was silent, his ministerial colleagues were not.
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Joseph Ofseyer of Congregation Shearith Israel said that Railey had
suffered for his message of justice and equality but that the religious
community would not "be cowed into silence" and "permit such a person to stand
alone."
</P>
<P>
Almost lost or overlooked in the outcry was an observation by Police Lt. Ron
Waldrop that the abusive letters appeared to be the work of one individual and
not the concerted effort of a white supremacist group.
</P>
<P>
"There's no central theme," he added.
</P>
<P>
A short time later, the FBI determined that the death threats had been written
on an office typewriter at First Methodist.
</P>
<P>
Walker Railey's rise to clerical prominence seemed almost preordained from his
turbulent childhood days in Owensboro, Ky., a coal mining town on the south
bank of the Ohio River.
</P>
<P>
The oldest of three children, Railey grew up a nonsmoker and nondrinker who
delivered his first sermon at age 17 and became something of a circuit preacher
while a history major at Western Kentucky University.
</P>
<P>
He attended Vanderbilt Divinity School for a year, then headed to Dallas and
the Perkins Theological Seminary at Southern Methodist University.
</P>
<P>
It was there, in 1970, that he met Margaret Nicolai, an equally talented,
intelligent and religiously dedicated young musician whom everyone called
Peggy. She had arrived at SMU from Wisconsin to pursue a master's degree in
organ music.
</P>
<P>
Acquaintances say Peggy recognized early on that young Walker was a man with
great ambition and potential but that she was not much taken with him
romantically. His persistence won her over and the couple were married in
August, 1971.
</P>
<P>
After obtaining a doctor of ministry in 1973, Railey ministered to several
rural churches in Oklahoma and then was appointed an associate pastor at First
Methodist in Dallas. In 1980, after a stint as a senior minister at a suburban
Dallas church, he returned to First Methodist as senior pastor at age 33.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eight Ministers Became Bishops
</P>
<P>
The appointment was the most dramatic step in a meteoric rise. Although not
even the largest Methodist church in Dallas, First Methodist had the reputation
as the nation's mother church of Methodism, in no small part because eight of
its ministers had gone on to become bishops.
</P>
<P>
Under Railey's leadership, First Methodist grew and prospered, its membership
approaching 6,000 and its annual budget doubling to $2 million. And although
Railey himself was short, balding and physically unimposing, his radiant
ministry served as a magnet for the young, energetic and socially conscious
while not alienating older, more conservative parishioners.
</P>
<P>
He spoke out boldly against those who practiced or condoned racial intolerance.
He clashed with a City Council member over what he perceived to be a racist
stance on illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
He challenged President Reagan to take a "more visible and articulate stand"
for peace and he once said of fundamentalist Jerry Falwell, "I guarantee he
doesn't speak for the Kingdom of God, let alone the people in it."
</P>
<P>
When the threats came, the Raileys seemed to take them in stride. The FBI
encouraged Peggy Railey and the children to leave town for a while. Although
she went to her parents' home for four days, she did not seem overly concerned.
</P>
<P>
Diane Yarrington, wife of First Methodist's minister of music and one of Peggy
Railey's closest friends, said Peggy told her that she and Walker were taking
precautions but that they refused to be intimidated.
</P>
<P>
Long before the attack, the Yarringtons and Raileys pledged to care for one
another's children in the event of tragedy.
</P>
<P>
That pledge would soon come due.
</P>
<P>
As Railey and his wife lay near death in the same intensive care unit, police
were anxious to talk again with First Methodist's senior pastor. After his
first interview, police found unspecified "inconsistencies" in Railey's account
of April 21.
</P>
<P>
Friends in the church hired a tough, no-nonsense criminal defense attorney
named Doug Mulder to advise Railey, and as the minister recovered, he wasn't
talking to police.
</P>
<P>
He did, however, speak with reporters.
</P>
<P>
"To be honest with you . . . I just don't know anything," he told a veteran
religion reporter.
</P>
<P>
Later, he told the Associated Press:
</P>
<P>
"I didn't attack my wife. I didn't plan to have someone attack my wife. I
didn't orchestrate a plan to attack my wife. And if I had written the letters,
I wouldn't have written them on a typewriter in the church. But I didn't write
them."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Don't Understand Why'
</P>
<P>
He could not rationalize his suicide attempt, which he knew was construed by
some as an admission of guilt.
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand why I did it, any more than I understand why I lived beyond
it."
</P>
<P>
Mulder arranged for a private polygraph test, which indicated that Railey did
not try to kill his wife. Presumably because of those results, Mulder approved
a police-administered examination the next day. That exercise was described as
"inconclusive."
</P>
<P>
"The results showed that he didn't have anything to do with the attack, nor did
he conspire with anyone," Mulder said.
</P>
<P>
Though Railey's followers took new heart, investigators were unimpressed and
restated the ongoing request to interview him.
</P>
<P>
Holt accused Mulder of misrepresenting the outcome of the police-administered
examination. He suggested that some of Railey's responses were "untruthful,"
but refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
All but overlooked in the flap over the polygraphs was an unattributed police
statement that Railey's account of his activities the night of April 21 was "in
direct conflict with indisputable evidence."
</P>
<P>
The key word was "indisputable."
</P>
<P>
The frosted blonde with the sparkling eyes was no stranger to the congregation
at First United Methodist Church. Lucy Papillon grew up in the magnificent
sanctuary, the daughter of the Rev. Robert E. Goodrich Jr., a former senior
pastor and later a Methodist bishop.
</P>
<P>
A portrait of Goodrich, who died in 1985, hangs in the First Methodist foyer.
</P>
<P>
"She had that knotted Goodrich chin, his thin, drawn smile, and the dark eyes
that were his most distinctive feature -- eyes that seemed remote but also
searching and intelligent," journalist Larry Wright, a childhood acquaintance,
wrote in Texas Monthly.
</P>
<P>
"It was a strong face, like her father's, and if in some lights it appeared
hard, in others you could detect a vulnerable and even wounded soul who had
lived past the point where life surprised her."
</P>
<P>
As a youngster, Lucy played the piano in Sunday school and was a cheerleader at
an exclusive girls' school. She entered Southern Methodist University in 1959
to pursue a degree in music education and, four years later, married a
Methodist preacher. They were divorced in 1973 after she bore two sons.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worked Variety of Jobs
</P>
<P>
Friends say she worked at a variety of jobs, including a stint as a part-time
model. Somewhere along the way she became enamored with psychology. She married
and divorced again and, in 1982, received a doctorate in psychology and moved
to California to complete her training. She found various jobs in her new field
there and reportedly began to visit the Esalen commune.
</P>
<P>
And it was there that Lucy decided to take on her identity as "Papillon,"
French for butterfly. In 1986 she opened a private psychology practice in
Dallas and legally changed her name to Lucy Papillon.
</P>
<P>
On July 14, 1987, Dallas County's chief prosecutor sat down with police and the
FBI and heard for the first time all the facts of the case.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Challenged to 'Talk or Walk'
</P>
<P>
His face flushed with anger, his thick mustache almost bristling, Norm Kinne,
53, stormed from the meeting room into a cluster of reporters and challenged
Walker Railey, as one headline proclaimed, to "talk or walk."
</P>
<P>
Eyes flashing and his finger jabbing at the nearest of four television cameras,
Kinne declared:
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of this man fooling with the justice system and the life of his
wife. . . . I'm going to tell you, Walker Railey, I'm tired of you messing with
the Dallas Police Department, and you're going to come before the Dallas County
grand jury and you're going to clear up these discrepancies, or you're going to
leave the country!"
</P>
<P>
Kinne could subpoena Railey to appear before grand jurors, but he had no way to
compel him to answer questions if he invoked the constitutional protection
against self-incrimination. Nor was it in the fiery prosecutor's domain to
order a reticent Railey out of the country.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Photographs Triggered Outburst
</P>
<P>
But at that moment, nobody was foolhardy enough to argue the issue with Kinne.
</P>
<P>
Later that evening, a vaguely contrite Kinne said it was the photographs of
Peggy Railey after the attack that so outraged him and triggered the outburst.
</P>
<P>
"I got irritated because we have a lady here who is a loving wife and mother
and who is lying in a hospital more dead than alive," he said. "And we have an
alleged pillar of the community who will not talk to us about this."
</P>
<P>
Six days before Kinne's outburst, a Dallas Morning News story linked Lucy
Papillon to the Railey case, calling her a potential "reluctant witness."
</P>
<P>
The article said mobile telephone records revealed that Railey called Papillon
twice the night of the attack. Railey had neglected to mention those calls in
his lengthy interview with police the morning after April 21.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Calls Placed to Home
</P>
<P>
Phone records also showed that Railey placed two calls to his own home between
midnight and 12:30 a.m., the last one about 10 minutes before he reported
finding his wife near death on the garage floor.
</P>
<P>
Investigators refused to discuss the significance of the mobile phone records
but it seemed safe to assume they somehow represented the "indisputable
evidence" of inconsistencies in Railey's story.
</P>
<P>
Later, on the eve of a grand jury meeting on the Railey case, the Morning News
reported that Railey had visited Papillon the night his wife was attacked.
</P>
<P>
Inside the jury room, Kinne was eager to confront Railey, although he was
certain that the embattled minister would refuse to answer questions and invoke
his Fifth Amendment rights. Railey took the Fifth -- 43 times.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knew Nothing About Attack
</P>
<P>
"I have followed the advice of my lawyer consistently and will consistently do
that," Railey remarked brusquely when he emerged from the closed-door session.
</P>
<P>
Papillon spent an hour before the panel and, according to her attorney, Phil
Burleson, answered every question. She knew nothing about the attack, Burleson
said, and then cautioned reporters against drawing conclusions that his client
was romantically linked with Railey.
</P>
<P>
But it made no difference. Leaks poured out of the grand jury room that Lucy
Papillon was Walker Railey's mistress.
</P>
<P>
According to those present, Papillon told grand jurors she first met Railey on
a religious television show and they became romantically involved in June,
1986, about the same time she changed her name. She said she had accompanied
Railey on several ministerial trips and had vacationed with him in California.
</P>
<P>
Nor were their liaisons confined to this country. Papillon revealed that Railey
stopped over for a prearranged rendezvous in London while returning from a
World Methodist Council meeting in Nairobi, Kenya, in July, 1986.
</P>
<P>
In one particularly chilling disclosure, Lucy said they embraced and kissed in
Walker's hospital suite while Peggy lay near death nearby.
</P>
<P>
Despite the sensational revelations, the grand jury testimony raised almost as
many questions as it answered. And the "indisputable evidence" remained cloaked
in secrecy.
</P>
<P>
"We still have a lot of discrepancies, but we're not going to discuss them,"
said Police Lt. Waldrop. "There is no statue of limitations on attempted
murder, and that's how long we'll be working on it."
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the discrepancies and the indisputable evidence did unfold.
</P>
<P>
On the night of the attack, Railey made several calls from a cellular telephone
installed in his car at church expense only hours earlier as a security measure
because of anonymous threats. A phone company computer recorded the times.
</P>
<P>
Railey called home at 5:55 p.m. to say he was leaving the office. At 5:58 p.m.,
he telephoned Papillon and talked for one minute.
</P>
<P>
Arriving home shortly before 6:30 p.m., Railey said he found his wife working
on a faulty garage door lock with a bar of soap. Investigators later found no
trace of soap on the lock, which was working fine.
</P>
<P>
Railey said he sat on the hood of his wife's Chrysler and talked with her for
several minutes. He told her he intended to spend the evening on a research
project at the SMU libraries. He did not change from his business suit and left
the house a little after 6:30.
</P>
<P>
At 6:38 p.m., Railey, who never wore a watch, called on the car phone for the
time.
</P>
<P>
He said he spent half an hour or so at SMU's Bridwell Library and was back in
his car by 7:26 p.m., at which time he phoned the family baby-sitter and
discussed plans for a trip to San Antonio the Raileys planned later in the
week.
</P>
<P>
At 7:32 p.m., he phoned Papillon at her home near SMU. He drove directly to her
house, where he spent the next 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Railey Went Back to Library
</P>
<P>
Railey told a friend later he went there to get some relaxation tapes to help
relieve stress.
</P>
<P>
From 8 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., Railey was back at Bridwell, where he asked a
librarian what time the library closed. At 8:30, Railey, using a pay phone,
called home on a private line. Peggy Railey told him she was putting the
children to bed. She then called her parents long distance in Tyler and talked
from 8:49 p.m. until 9:14 p.m.
</P>
<P>
At 8:53 p.m., Raily bought gas at a Texaco station near campus. After drinking
a wine cooler, he said, he returned to Fondren Library, SMU's main library. But
no one saw him there until after 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
At 9:30 p.m., a jogger in the Raileys' neighborhood spotted a man in a business
suit and street shoes running through a yard south of the Railey home. Between
10:15 p.m. and 10:30 p.m., a neighbor heard rustling sounds in the alley behind
the home.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tried to Leave Business Card
</P>
<P>
Sometime after 11 p.m., a librarian saw Railey at Fondren. Upon leaving at
midnight, he attempted to give his business card to a student at the checkout
desk. On the back of the card was a message requesting help in finding research
information. Railey also noted the time, 10:30 p.m., when in fact it was
midnight, the student told police.
</P>
<P>
At 12:03 a.m., Railey called home on the car phone, but this time he used the
public line. According to friends, the family seldom answered the public line,
which was connected to an answering machine.
</P>
<P>
"Hi, Babe," he said. "I'm calling you from my mobile phone. Peg, it's about,
oh, I don't know. I don't have a watch. It's somewhere between 10:30 and 10:45,
somewhere along in there. I worked at Bridwell until they closed and now I'm
going to Fondren."
</P>
<P>
This could not have been true. He had in fact just left Fondren, according to
other accounts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lock the Garage Door'
</P>
<P>
"I'll be in about 1. If you want to, go ahead and lock the garage door and I'll
park out front. It really doesn't matter to me at this point. My concern is
that you're safe. . . ."
</P>
<P>
This portion of the tape might explain why Peggy Railey would enter the garage
that night. Even so, Railey would still have to explain why, if he really
intended to speak with his wife, he had called on the public line and left a
message.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three minutes later, Railey phoned the answering machine again, and on
this occasion gave the correct time: 12:29.
</P>
<P>
"Hi, Babe," he began. "It's 12:29 and I'm on the way home from SMU. . . .
Everything really went well. I got a lot accomplished. I had to leave my card
with the reference librarian because there was one deal that I couldn't quite
work out. I'm not calling on the private line because I know you're already
asleep, but in case you get up with the kids, I just wanted you to know that
I'm on my way home. It's 12:30. I'll be home about 12:45.
</P>
<P>
"Love you. Bye-bye."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Sign of a Struggle
</P>
<P>
At just past 12:40, Railey drove into his driveway and found his wife.
</P>
<P>
There was no sign of a struggle. There was no skin under her fingernails to
indicate that she had either fought her assailant or scratched herself when
grasping at whatever was pulled around her throat.
</P>
<P>
Railey said he determined that the children were safe and notified police.
</P>
<P>
"Dallas Emergency, Ms. . . ," the dispatcher answered.
</P>
<P>
"This is Walker Railey," he interrupted. "Send the paramedics and police,
please."
</P>
<P>
An ambulance arrived, along with neighbors. Inside the house, both children
were in the living room, Megan watching a silent television screen and Ryan
staring blankly ahead.
</P>
<P>
Months later, Kinne told a reporter he thought it possible that Ryan witnessed
the attack, but he said the youngster gave investigators inconsistent accounts
of what might have happened that night.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Daddy did it," the boy told investigators once.
</P>
<P>
Doctors transferred Peggy Railey, her body alive but her brain barely
functioning, from a Dallas hospital to a nursing home in east Texas so she
could be near her parents.
</P>
<P>
Bill and Billie Jo Nicolai live in Tyler, but they had spent almost all day
every day in Dallas, about 60 miles away, attending to Peggy's needs. Though a
full-service hospital was no longer required, she remained in a vegetative
state from which she might never awaken.
</P>
<P>
Back in Dallas, no sign was posted, but the Raileys' home was quietly put on
the market and sold.
</P>
<P>
Walker Railey voluntarily surrendered his credentials as a minister in the
United Methodist Church, and then surrendered control of his wife's legal
affairs to her parents. He granted temporary custody of his children to the
friends who had kept them since April 22, John and Diane Yarrington.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mother Assumed Guardianship
</P>
<P>
Billie Jo Nicolai requested that a court grant her guardianship of her
daughter, and Railey waived his right to continue in that traditionally spousal
role.
</P>
<P>
And then, after the stunning developments and disclosures of mid-November,
Railey vanished.
</P>
<P>
"I know he has some job prospects," Yarrington said.
</P>
<P>
Over the next few months, Railey and Dallas reporters played a game of
hide-and-seek.
</P>
<P>
In early December, Railey told religion reporter Helen Parmley of the Dallas
Morning News in a telephone interview from California that he fled despair, not
speculation. And he maintained that he was not abandoning his children.
</P>
<P>
"In this case, while I am relocating, looking for work, financially strapped,
not knowing where I'm going to end up or what I'm going to be doing, everybody
involved in this drama believes . . . the most stable, loving, Christian
environment they can be in is where they are," he said.
</P>
<P>
But before anybody could get themselves too lathered up over Railey's plight,
Dallas Times Herald columnist Laura Miller put a new slant on the case by
telling a tale of the anger and indignation of Peggy Railey's family -- her
father and her grandmother.
</P>
<P>
Both believe Railey was behind the attack.
</P>
<P>
The motive? "A divorced man doesn't get to be bishop," said the grandmother,
Ella Renfro.
</P>
<P>
Larry Wright, a contributing editor at Texas Monthly magazine, grew up in the
First United Methodist Church in Dallas. His childhood pastor was Robert
Goodrich Jr., Lucy Papillon's father.
</P>
<P>
He left the church once in disenchantment but had been drawn back by Railey's
socially contemporary ministry. Then he had seen the devastation at First
Methodist after the attack on Peggy, Walker's suicide attempt and the
minister's affair with Lucy.
</P>
<P>
So Wright was less a journalist than a confused and angry member of the
congregation when he confronted Railey.
</P>
<P>
Did Peggy know about his affair with Lucy?
</P>
<P>
"We -- that never came up," Railey stammered.
</P>
<P>
She didn't know?
</P>
<P>
"I can only say it never emerged."
</P>
<P>
Did she suspect?
</P>
<P>
"I have no way of knowing, regarding that, that she suspected at all, about
anything."
</P>
<P>
Changing the subject, Railey revealed he had slipped into the First Methodist
sanctuary to attend funeral services for a family friend. Some of his former
parishioners avoided him but most embraced him.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Could Feel Pain'
</P>
<P>
"They could feel my pain," Railey said, crying. He said he also felt love.
</P>
<P>
Did you feel a sense of shame, Wright asked.
</P>
<P>
"I felt a great need to be forgiven, if that's what you're talking about."
</P>
<P>
Wright decided that was as much of a concession as he was likely to get. But
before departing, he said he could not construct an innocent man out of
Railey's behavior. The journalist recounted Railey's misleading testimony to
the police, his avoidance of the grand jury and his inexplicable actions on the
night of the attack.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Think You Are Guilty'
</P>
<P>
"I think you are a guilty person," Wright said.
</P>
<P>
"I hear what you're saying," Railey replied.
</P>
<P>
Wright did not know what to think. Railey failed to absorb his blunt
accusation, choosing instead to analyze it with detachment.
</P>
<P>
"I'm aware that nobody can sit down with all the facts that are supposedly
known . . . and just make it all fit. That's a frustration that everyone has
felt, including me," Railey said.
</P>
<P>
"Confess," Wright urged him. "It will haunt you forever, it will drive you
crazy."
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if that's a word of advice, a backhand comfort or what," Railey
said. "I'm not guilty. I didn't do it. I don't feel tormented by the guilt of
what I didn't do."
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 2, Billie Jo Nicolai filed a legal bombshell in civil court, accusing
Railey of "maliciously" attempting to kill his wife and orchestrating a "clumsy
attempt" to cover his actions with a phony alibi.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit sought damages for "physical and mental pain, disfigurement,
anguish and physical impairment" on behalf of Mrs. Nicolai's comatose daughter.
</P>
<P>
Concern over the cost of Peggy Railey's medical expenses was the overriding
reason for the action, but the family's decision was also emotional, said
Billie Jo Nicolai's attorney, Bill Arnold.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Are Bitter'
</P>
<P>
"They are bitter," he said. "They are angry."
</P>
<P>
Ted Nicolai, Peggy's younger brother, revealed that Railey had visited his wife
no more than three times and that after a Christmas visit with his two
children, Ryan had suffered severe emotional problems.
</P>
<P>
Kinne, Dallas' chief prosecutor, had sent an investigator to question Ryan
about the night of April 21, and the youngster talked freely about almost
everything. But whenever the investigator asked about the attack, Ryan would
tune her out. He would turn his back and try to leave the room.
</P>
<P>
Railey moved to California, to a Victorian flat not far from San Francisco Bay.
The rent reportedly was $1,600, and both he and Papillon signed the lease.
</P>
<P>
Initial attempts to serve Railey with legal notice of the Nicolai civil suit
were unsuccessful. Eventually, he was spotted at a hotel, and papers were
slapped under the windshield wiper of a car driven by Papillon, with Railey
apparently slumped down inside.
</P>
<P>
Precisely one year after the events of April, 1987, a state district judge
ruled that Walker Railey "intentionally, knowingly, maliciously and brutally
attempted to strangle his wife" and cover up his actions with a "false alibi."
</P>
<P>
Judge John Whittington issued a preliminary civil judgment on April 22, 1988,
holding Railey financially liable for the injuries to his wife. The extent of
damages would be determined later by a jury.
</P>
<P>
The ruling, although significant, had no bearing on the criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
Whittington's action came after Railey failed to respond to legal notices of
the suit. The judge said Railey, by his technical default, had admitted all the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fled Bay Area
</P>
<P>
Railey could no longer be found. Under siege from the media, he broke the lease
on the San Francisco "love nest" he shared with Papillon on her visits from
Dallas. It appeared he had fled the Bay Area altogether.
</P>
<P>
"The court can issue a subpoena that compels him to come answer my questions,"
Arnold said. "But today, I have less of an idea where he is than at any time
since this case started."
</P>
<P>
In June, doctors reported a slight improvement in Peggy Railey's condition and
she was returned to Dallas and placed in the Baylor Institute for
Rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Dr. William Parker, the institute's medical director, said she could turn her
head and hear, but could not process what she heard.
</P>
<P>
"If we can establish anything that seems to stimulate a response that could be
interpreted as functional, then we would continue to try, through repetition,
to improve on that," he said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Condition Downgraded
</P>
<P>
Parker said he didn't think his team of specialists would be able to determine
whether Peggy Railey would ever communicate again.
</P>
<P>
"I think the odds are probably going to be against it, but time is the only
thing that's going to tell," he said.
</P>
<P>
After more than a year in a vegetative state, doctors downgraded her condition
to a "persistent vegetative state," meaning, as a neurosurgeon explained, that
her chances for recovery were "nil."
</P>
<P>
After two months in Dallas, she was quietly returned to the nursing home in
Tyler where her parents resumed their tender, but apparently hopeless, daily
care.
</P>
<P>
Norm Kinne sat puffing his pipe in the district attorney's office and
reflecting on the Railey case, his opinions no less candid than when he first
viewed the terrible pictures of Peggy Railey's wounds.
</P>
<P>
"This guy's a liar," Kinne said. "He's trying to cover his tracks. He wasn't
where he was at the time he says he was. Now the question is, if he wasn't
there, where was he?
</P>
<P>
"The conclusion that everybody's drawn is that he was home choking out his
wife.
</P>
<P>
"But that doesn't necessarily follow. There's no proof he was at the scene at
the time she was strangled. There's no evidence that he strangled her or that
he knew who strangled her or that he arranged or participated in any way."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Concrete Evidence
</P>
<P>
That's not to say Kinne didn't think about prosecuting Walker Railey. He
visualized presenting all the evidence that showed Railey lied, that he
contrived an alibi and that he told no one of visiting his girlfriend that
night.
</P>
<P>
But with a defense move for an instructed verdict of innocent, the judge might
ask, "Where is the evidence that he choked his wife?" Kinne said.
</P>
<P>
The trial would probably be over before it began.
</P>
<P>
As 1988 drew to an end, Kinne had not surrendered hope that the case might
someday be solved, but any possibility was a long shot. Peggy Railey might
miraculously recover and identify her assailant, or even young Ryan Railey
might have seen something and be able to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nothing Incriminating
</P>
<P>
Lucy Papillon might eventually shed light on the case, but Kinne once pointed
out that she had said nothing incriminating "since we don't have adultery laws
anymore."
</P>
<P>
For Kinne, Walker Railey remained the ultimate enigma.
</P>
<P>
"The last thing you'd expect from a guy like him would be to give up his wife
and kids and flit off to California. Just say to hell with it and take off.
It's just not what you'd expect from a man of his stature.
</P>
<P>
"It gives every indication of guilt, whether he is guilty or not."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Railey Didn't Show
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 5, Judge Whittington heard testimony in a one-day trial to determine if
Walker Railey should pay damages to the Nicolai family. Railey didn't show up.
</P>
<P>
The family was awarded $16 million -- half to cover Peggy's care, half to
punish Railey. It was a ruling more of symbolism than substance, a hollow
victory.
</P>
<P>
Arnold said he didn't know where Railey was, or how much money he had. He
doubted that his wife's family would ever collect the $16 million.
</P>
<P>
On videotape, the court watched therapists treating Peggy Railey, who has
virtually no body control and a haunting, lifeless look in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
Still, her sister-in-law, Linda Nicolai, told of an experience at the hospital
one day that suggested the depth of Peggy Railey's anguish.
</P>
<P>
As Peggy's wheelchair went down the hall, she passed a man exercising with a
cord similar to what police believe was used to choke Peggy.
</P>
<P>
Peggy Railey began sweating, hyperventilating and rubbing her arms together.
</P>
<P>
Linda Nicolai added:
</P>
<P>
"She kept looking at me . . . with this wild look on her face and trying to
tell me something."

The Queen of England rewarded 907 people, from a beekeeper to a banker to
ex-Trade and Industry Minister Leon Brittan, with titles or medals in her
traditional New Year's honors list. Brittan, who resigned after leaking a
secret document in 1986, was granted a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II, as was
sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi. Also on the list, mostly compiled on the
recommendation of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government, were newly
dubbed knight Evelyn de Rothschild, chairman of N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons and
a member of the well-known banking family's British branch, and British
Beekeeping Society Vice Chairman William Hooper, named a Member of the Order of
the British Empire. Actor Peter Cushing, known for horror films and for
portraying Sherlock Holmes, was made an Officer of the Order. Among several
athletes honored was six-time world darts champion Eric Bristow, who became a
Member of the Order and the first in his field to be so recognized.
</P>
<P>
 -- Bandleader Cab Calloway, who had to cancel a New Year's Eve appearance in
Chicago because of illness, relayed greetings to his fans through his wife,
Nuffie. "I wish everyone a Happy New Year," she quoted the "prince of hi-de-ho"
as saying after she visited him at White Plains (N.Y.) Hospital Center.
Calloway has been listed in critical but stable condition since emergency
surgery for unspecified abdominal troubles that caused him to collapse Dec. 21
during a concert tour in Japan. Nuffie Calloway said her husband, 81, "thanks
everyone for their calls, flowers, letters and expressions of love, and he
expects to feel better any minute."
</P>
<P>
 -- As he packed up office memorabilia recently in Newark, N.J., retiring
Democratic Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr. looked back on his 40 years in Congress. He
recalled rushing past reporters after the Judiciary Committee he chaired voted
articles of impeachment against President Richard M. Nixon in 1974, saying he
went into a cubbyhole office, telephoned his wife and wept. Rodino, 79, pointed
proudly to photographs of himself with President John F. Kennedy and his
brother Robert, President Lyndon B. Johnson and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Democrat Donald M. Payne will succeed Rodino, becoming the state's first black
congressman. DAVE JOHNSON

KEEPING PETRODOLLARS AT HOME;
</P>
<P>
SAUDIS MAKING EFFORT TO BOOST REGIONAL TOURISM
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Saudis, fewer petrodollars in their pockets and worried about security and
culture shock, have started looking for holidays at home and finding that there
is more to the country than sand.
</P>
<P>
In the oil price heyday of the 1970s, Saudi Muslims flocked to the kingdom's
air terminals to escape the heat and monotony of the desert for the great
tourist capitals -- Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles, the French and
Spanish Rivieras, Istanbul and Cairo.
</P>
<P>
But local tourism has been on the rise for the last five years, spearheaded by
a government campaign to encourage Saudis to spend their vacation dollars at
home.
</P>
<P>
"There are quite a lot of religiously conservative families who suffer when
they go abroad," said Ibrahim al Sayed, director general of tourism development
in the country's mountainous southwest Asir region. "They don't want their
teen-agers to copy Westerners."
</P>
<P>
He added that many Saudis are also acutely aware that language and cultural
barriers make them attractive victims for con artists abroad.
</P>
<P>
"I've traveled in Europe and I've faced some of the troubles," said Fahd al
Sayejh, public relations manager at the Riyadh Intercontinental Hotel. "My
family's now looking for a villa in Abha (in the cooler Asir region). There are
many people who spend their summers there who used to go to Europe.
</P>
<P>
"It's beautiful. It reminds us of the old days when we used to go to Lebanon
every summer. The mountains are the same," he added. "(But) in the oil boom
years, businessmen thought nothing of driving to the airport and boarding any
available international flight. Now people are more aware of spending their
money."
</P>
<P>
Tourism within Saudi Arabia may seem like a hard sell, given the country's
reputation as a "desert kingdom," lacking much in the way of amusement.
</P>
<P>
But beaches along the country's eastern border on the Persian Gulf draw big
crowds.
</P>
<P>
Jidda on the Red Sea attracts scuba-diving enthusiasts and Najran, close to
Yemen, offers unusual architecture. For a change of scenery, many tourists try
the southwest.
</P>
<P>
"The whole southwest area is very popular," said Antoni Kuhnen, who runs the
Al-Baha Motel in that region. Kuhnen estimates that the motel, opened in 1985,
now books around 20,000 tourists a year.
</P>
<P>
Al-Baha, Saudi Arabia's smallest province, is situated between Taif, where the
government retreats into the mountains for the summer months, and Abha, capital
of Asir province, which boasts 1,736 square miles of national park.
</P>
<P>
A local newspaper noted that "visitors to the Abha region reached an
unprecedented number, to the extent that the real estate offices in Abha cannot
cope with the great demand for furnished and unfurnished flats."
</P>
<P>
An estimated 800,000 visitors were reported to have made it despite a
relatively small airport.
</P>
<P>
The recent popularity of in-country tourism is due largely to the government.
Five years ago, the few tourists who came to this region had to either camp out
or rely on the kindness of strangers for accommodation.
</P>
<P>
Now, there are five hotels in the area, some of them bankrolled by the Finance
Ministry. Private businessmen are also being encouraged to invest in tourism.
</P>
<P>
An amusement park would make the area more attractive to Saudi families who
generally have large numbers of children to entertain, he said. Land has
already been allocated, but awaits an investor.
</P>
<P>
Al-Baha does not lack scenic beauty. At nearly 10,000 feet above sea level, the
air is cool, crisp, and a bit damp -- a welcome change from just about anyplace
else in the kingdom during the summer months.
</P>
<P>
The mountains, rough, craggy, and dotted with scrubby green plants, rise
dramatically out of the Tihama Valley and are populated by shepherds tending
flocks of sheep and goats. Baboons lope down the mountainside, carrying scraps
of food fed to them by motel staff and early rising guests.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the facilities are there, the tourists will come," said Kuhnen, who
nonetheless believes the region suffers for lack of recreational diversions.

BRAZIL'S FISHERMEN -- JANGADEIROS -- CLING TO TRADITION AS THEY REAP SEA'S
BOUNTY
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER ATWOOD, Reuters
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
FORTALEZA, Brazil
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just before sunset, the fishermen sail into Fortaleza Harbor on their rafts and
dump the day's catch of mackerel, moray eels and red snappers on the sand.
People gather around shouting their bids.
</P>
<P>
Fisherman Raminundo Nonato Tavares comes away with 13,000 cruzados (about $13)
-- not bad for a day's work, but nothing like the old times.
</P>
<P>
"When I was a boy, we'd fish for half the time we do now and catch twice as
much," said Tavares, who is 40 but whose weather-beaten face looks years older.
</P>
<P>
"We used to come to port with the boat weighing low in the water from all the
fish," Tavares said during a recent visit.
</P>
<P>
Tavares is one of thousands of men on Brazil's northeast coast who for years
have been fishing on jangadas, or small wooden rafts, but who now see their
livelihood disappearing.
</P>
<P>
Overfishing by big commercial trawlers and a boom in the shrimp trade, which
kills tons of fish, have been cutting into their catch and forcing many to seek
steadier work on trawlers.
</P>
<P>
About 200 jangadas now sail out of Fortaleza Harbor, where 20 years ago there
were about double that number, said Wilson Goncalves, president of the local
fishermen's union in this city of 1.3 million people.
</P>
<P>
Work is risky on a jangada, not much bigger than a double bed and powered only
by the wind, and the fishing season lasts only six months a year, as the sea is
too stormy in winter.
</P>
<P>
But jangadeiros, as the fishermen are known, cling to tradition.
</P>
<P>
They refuse the usual equipment for commercial fishing like motors, nets and
compasses, relying entirely on hook and line and a knowledge passed down from
generations of how to find the fish.
</P>
<P>
Most are illiterate and, since their early teens, have never changed their
routine of sailing out to sea before dawn and returning before sunset.
</P>
<P>
They bring most of their catch home to their families and sell the rest to tide
them over during the winter months.
</P>
<P>
"The jangadeiro does not understand or want technology. He's a subsistence
fishermen who will rely on custom until the day he dies," said Goncalves.
</P>
<P>
Custom has well-served Tavares and other jangadeiros for generations.
</P>
<P>
He can tell by the color of the water which fish will be most plentiful in a
certain area. Darker, deeper water suggests the presence of mackerel, grouper
and -- if it's a lucky day -- shark.
</P>
<P>
A green hue often means a coral reef lies below, and that means the moray eel,
which will bring Tavares a high price because of its tasty meat and because
trawlers using nets rarely snare them.
</P>
<P>
Using the weather, ocean currents and even the phases of the moon as his
guides, he says, he can almost always find the kind of fish he is seeking.
</P>
<P>
"My father taught me most of it, but some of it I had to learn myself. The sea
is always changing," he said as he cast his line in a place that he thought
would yield red snapper, a small, ruddy fish. Within half an hour, he had
caught five.
</P>
<P>
But the 20th Century is closing in on the jangadeiros, who bitterly resent the
commercial trawlers they say are emptying their waters of fish.
</P>
<P>
"So many fish in the ocean, and our share is so small after the fishing boats
come through," said Francisco dos Reis, who often joins Tavares on his craft.
</P>
<P>
"We used to be able to fill that basket with fish. Now we're lucky if we can
fill it halfway after a whole day at sea," Dos Reis said.
</P>
<P>
One reason for the drop in their catch is the boom in Fortaleza's shrimp
industry, which exports heavily to the United States.
</P>
<P>
When shrimp fishermen haul in their nets, they also bring in thousands of fish
that have gotten entangled and died. The fishermen throw them overboard
because, unlike the shrimp, fish won't bring in coveted export dollars.

FORGOTTEN TRIBES OF LEBANON'S WADI KHALED THRIVE ON SMUGGLING OF GOODS TO SYRIA

WADI KHALED, Lebanon
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trapped in this northern Lebanese valley, a forgotten community living by
tribal traditions thrives on smuggling goods across the river to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Despite the affluence this has brought, the Bedouins of Wadi Khaled feel as if
they are prisoners in their own land, captive because of a historical mishap
that left them with no citizenship rights. Their status has been "under study"
since 1968.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 years ago, the tribes' fear of officials drove the people to hide
in the woods. They missed Lebanon's only official census, conducted in 1932
when the country was still under French mandate. No population count has been
carried out since, so the status of the residents of Wadi Khaled is still
pending.
</P>
<P>
Abu Mustapha, clad in traditional Arab headdress and gray gallabia, or
ankle-length shirt, said the tribesmen mistook census officials for envoys of
the Ottoman Empire authorities.
</P>
<P>
"They hid in the woods because they were afraid their children would be drafted
into the Ottoman army. They were illiterate people and did not understand that
we were not under Ottoman rule anymore," said Abu Mustapha.
</P>
<P>
The Bedouins of Wadi Khaled hold residence permits, issued to all foreigners
living in Lebanon, and a document which classifies them in a "citizenship under
study" category.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Palestinians and other refugees in Lebanon who have a special travel
document, these tribesmen have no passports and can travel almost nowhere.
Syria is the only country that allows them inside its borders, just for brief
visits.
</P>
<P>
"We have become prisoners in our own land," said Sweid.
</P>
<P>
The people of Wadi Khaled -- named after Khaled Ibn al-Walid, who drove out the
Byzantine Christians -- are divided into tribes who trace their origin to what
is now Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Until the 1960s, they raised sheep in the bare rugged hills nearby. Then they
turned to trade.
</P>
<P>
"We are on the border between a socialist country (Syria) and a country that
believes in free trade (Lebanon)," said Bashir Hammoud.
</P>
<P>
Syria has strict import controls and the smuggled traffic across the Nahr
el-Bared river into the country includes television sets, radios, videos,
fruit, vegetables, canned food, coffee, sugar, building material, clothes and
shoes.
</P>
<P>
Wadi Khaled's marketplace, Al-Arida, is a favorite of Syrian families, with
prices given in Syrian pounds that the merchants later change to dollars at the
rate of 46 to a dollar.
</P>
<P>
"We sell here what Syrians can only buy on the black market in their country.
Everything they do not have they buy here," said Hammoud.
</P>
<P>
The Ghannam tribe, the largest and most influential, boasts that its standard
of living is higher than that of many people in the Lebanese capital, Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Most of its members live in spacious cement houses with almost no furniture.
They traditionally prefer sitting on the floor.
</P>
<P>
Khaled Sweid, who holds a degree in mathematics, estimated that each family in
the Ghannam tribe earned an average of about $200 per month compared to the
national minimum wage of $30 per month.
</P>
<P>
The residents of Wadi Khaled, all Sunni Muslims, have pleaded their case with
all the governments that have ruled Lebanon since independence in 1943, but to
no avail.
</P>
<P>
Christian politicians, who hold key posts in the government, have resisted
naturalizing 10,000 Muslims because it could upset the sectarian balance in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Our plight became the subject of bickering among politicians," said a Ghannam
tribesman, one of a group squatting in a smoke-filled room and sharing a meal
of lamb and rice.
</P>
<P>
"The solution for us lies with the Lebanese government. But now which one do we
turn to?"

AT $80 PER MUSHROOM, PRICE FOR MATSUTAKE IS HIGH EVEN FOR THE JAPANESE
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In the land of $7 apples and $6 boxes of granola, matsutake mushrooms are in a
class of their own.
</P>
<P>
Japanese drop their usual tones of careful politeness and become positively
rapturous in describing these unassuming brown fungi, their woodsy taste and
piney smell.
</P>
<P>
The owner of one of the world's most exclusive restaurants, Kicho, where meals
can run $800 a person and only an introduction from a previous customer can win
a reservation, recently wrote: "In autumn we can almost not do our business
without matsutake."
</P>
<P>
But for the uninitiated, it is the price tag of the matsutake, or pine-tree
mushrooms, that is so breathtaking: a few inches high and, in fact, rather
mushroom-like in appearance, a single well-shaped matsutake can cost as much as
$80; even an average one will run $40 per stem.
</P>
<P>
Matsutake are so pricey and so prized that matsutake fraud has now entered the
Japanese lexicon. Recently it was discovered that some of these mushrooms were
being sold with tiny lead slivers inserted in their stems to inflate their
weight and thus their asking price.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worth It to Japanese
</P>
<P>
For the Japanese, who adore all manner of mushrooms and use about half a dozen
different varieties in their everyday food, the price is clearly worth it. "I
love them," a Japanese newspaper editor said recently, as he dropped the
subject at hand -- stock market manipulation -- to wax eloquent about
matsutake.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese folk saying sums up the emotionalism toward matsutake: "The mountain
where you picked matsutake cannot be forgotten."
</P>
<P>
With this saying in mind, a farming community troubled by a high rate of
bachelorhood among its young men recently held a matsutake-picking party in an
effort to entice women back to the farm.
</P>
<P>
According to mushroom connoisseurs, matsutake are expensive because their
season is short -- just a few weeks in late fall -- and because they can grow
only in the wild. Japan's wilderness has been disappearing steadily in the face
of relentless urbanization, and the red pine trees around which matsutake
flourish have also been diminishing.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Domesticated Yet
</P>
<P>
The finest scientists have failed so far to domesticate the matsutake on a mass
scale, despite repeated efforts. Mie Ogoshi of Japan's Tsuji Cooking School
said that matsutake were much more common and much cheaper 20 years ago and
were used liberally in the kitchen. Now, however, they are rationed
parsimoniously: paper-thin slices in a special broth, a few bits mixed in a
rice dish or a few grilled with a touch of lime and soy sauce. One special soup
features a little matsutake with a touch of real gold shavings.
</P>
<P>
Demand for matsutake is so strong that the import-resistant Japanese have
turned to South Korea and China, where matsutake also grow and cost much less.
</P>
<P>
Mushroom aficionados insist that these imports do not taste as good as local
ones; among other drawbacks, to satisfy customs inspectors the matsutake must
be washed well, which attenuates their aroma, they say. Nonetheless, every
fall, die-hard matsutake lovers figure that it is worth the price of a
Tokyo-Seoul round-trip ticket (about $500) to fill a few boxes with fresh
Korean matsutake and lovingly carry them home.
</P>
<P>
Still, even in affluent Japan, there are many who find $80 per mushroom a bit
rich for the blood. One Japanese woman who raved about the taste and autumnal
smell of matsutake admitted, after calming down, that she had not bought one in
15 years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like They Are Gold'
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the price tag on the matsutake, it is like they are gold,"
acknowledged Ogoshi, of the cooking school. And like many high-priced foods in
Japan, including the beautiful cantaloupe grown here and sold, individually
wrapped, for $80 or more, matsutake most often are given as presents.
</P>
<P>
For those who love their matsutake but cannot afford them, one enterprising
Japanese company recently developed "essence of matsutake," a small vial of
which costs only $2.50. The liquid can be poured on top of the lowly shiitake
or ma-shu-ru-mu (white American-style mushroom), allowing the diner to imagine
it is the real thing.
</P>
<P>
For the truly desperate, stores sell a few slices of matsutake for the
comparatively reasonable price of $20. When sniffed very closely they do give
off a piney odor. Cooked -- one minute in a hot broiler or over a fire, with
drop of a little lime juice -- they taste, well, like a mushroom.

WESTERN OFFICIALS LOOK TO AFGHANISTAN AND SEE A NEW PROBLEM -- HEROIN
</P>

SAFED KOH REGION, Afghanistan
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In northeastern Afghanistan, small numbers of returned refugees have been
rebuilding their homes and replanting their terraced fields.
</P>
<P>
But not all the fields returned to the plow in the last year have been planted
with wheat and corn. Many -- perhaps one out of every two -- were turned over
to the cultivation of marijuana and opium-producing poppies.
</P>
<P>
In fact, many Western narcotics control officials, diplomats, some members of
the Afghan resistance, and Pakistani officials, are concerned that this region
could develop into the world's leading producer of heroin -- the potent drug
derived from opium.
</P>
<P>
The primary source of opium for the West remains Southeast Asia's "Golden
Triangle" -- Burma, Laos, and Thailand. But since the mid-1980s, international
narcotics control sources say, the "Golden Crescent" of Southwest Asia has
gained prominence.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
30% of Market
</P>
<P>
Together, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran account for at least 30% of the
United States heroin market, these sources estimate.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan, according to narcotics officials, is the region's largest
producer. Last year's opium crop is estimated at between 500 and 700 tons. The
1988-89 poppy season, which normally begins with the first rains in December,
is expected to increase output by 100 to 200 tons. The reasons for
Afghanistan's increased production include: lack of government control in much
of the countryside during the nine-year war against Soviet occupation;
crackdowns on cultivation in Pakistan, which have made Afghanistan a safer
production center; Tehran's apparent willingness to allow trafficking through
Iran; and growing demand in neighboring Pakistan and the West.
</P>
<P>
For many peasants, white-and-pink poppy flowers are the easiest and most
lucrative cash crop. Harvesting the sticky, black sap can bring a small farmer
up to $2,000 -- a fortune in this area. Dealers take the opium by horse and
mule across the border into Pakistan's tribal border districts; there, scores
of illicit laboratories process the opium into heroin.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult to Control
</P>
<P>
"We don't have to be Adam Smith to realize we have a problem," says Carlo
Boccia, a representative of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Paris.
"When drugs become more readily available, they become more difficult to
control."
</P>
<P>
Western narcotics officials say they do not know how much of Iran's
"tremendous" poppy production reaches the international market. Pakistan is
believed to have produced 200 or more tons of opium last year. Most of the
region's heroin is manufactured in Pakistani labs. (Ten pounds of opium produce
about one pound of pure heroin, which can sell for tens of thousands to a few
hundred thousand dollars in the West. Heroin sold in the West is diluted, about
5% pure.)
</P>
<P>
One of the most severe effects of this rapidly growing regional trade, Western
aid officials and other sources say, is its corrupting and undermining
influence on Pakistani and Afghan society. They cite:
</P>
<P>
* A rise in the number of Pakistani addicts, most of whom "chase the drag-on"
(smoke heroin), from an estimated 200,000 in the early 1980s to between 1
million to 3 million today.
</P>
<P>
* The spread of heroin abuse among Pakistan's 3 million Afghan refugees.
</P>
<P>
* Corruption that involves senior Pakistan government officials, Army officers,
politicians, refugee administrators, businessmen, tribal leaders, and members
of the Afghan resistance. This was alleged separately by narcotics and
intelligence officials, and Western aid sources.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gang Warfare Feared
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are fears that the "drug and gun culture" on both sides of
the border could increase gang warfare. "You have got to understand that it is
a huge business in this part of the world. There are terrible things going on,
and they involve a lot of people," says a worried representative of the Afghan
resistance.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's new prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, has described illegal drugs as
the country's "No. 1 problem" and has created a Ministry of Narcotics to tackle
it. Diplomats and aid workers are skeptical about chances for success.
</P>
<P>
"The only reason we have not yet seen the sort of violence you find in Colombia
(South America) is that enough people here are getting paid off to keep the
trade going," a Western aid official says. "The moment you start hitting where
it hurts, the situation will start getting nasty."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Route Through Karachi
</P>
<P>
Narcotics from eastern and northern Afghanistan and Pakistan's border areas are
channeled to Karachi; those from southern Afghanistan go toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
According to aid sources, trucks from the government-run National Logistics
Corporation, which normally carry goods to Afghan refugee camps, often take
heroin to Karachi.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of direct collaboration with the police, the Army, and the
refugee administration," says a Western official.
</P>
<P>
For appearances, sources say, a vehicle is sometimes deliberately sacrificed to
the police. The rest then proceed unhindered to Karachi, where the heroin is
taken by boat or plane to the Mideast and Europe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Berlin an Entry Point
</P>
<P>
Some sources allege that officials in Pakistan's National Shipping Company are
involved. Narcotics officials say East Berlin, a drugs gateway in the 1970s, is
once again becoming a major entry point.
</P>
<P>
The production of opium in southwest Afghanistan has come under the control of
local drug lords, cooperating closely with Pakistani traffickers as well as
drug syndicates from Europe and North America, intelligence sources say.
</P>
<P>
At Musa Qala, a fertile region in southern Afghanistan, poppy growing is
largely run by Nassim Akhun Zada, say journalists and relief workers who have
visited the area. Zada is a guerrilla commander, reportedly still affiliated
with an Afghan resistance party, the Harakat-i-Inqilab-i-Islami, but who
operates largely on his own. Western sources say Zada leads a private army of
1,200 fighters. Recently, there have been reports of pitched battles with a
rival, Abdul Rahman Khan of the Hizb-i-Islami resistance party.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government Role Seen
</P>
<P>
From Musa Qala, part of the opium harvest is transported to eastern Iran. But
most is taken to the Pakistani desert refugee camps at Gerde-Jangal. There,
resistance and aid sources say, trafficking is carried out in collaboration
with officers of Pakistan's Interservices Intelligence (ISI) organization.
</P>
<P>
At Gerde-Jangal, the opium is weighed and some is processed by local labs.
</P>
<P>
"There is so much dealing going on that the money is not counted but weighed,"
a Western aid representative says. Various sources, including a former
trafficker from Quetta, say narcotics are driven in five-vehicle convoys -- two
carrying drugs, the other three armed guards and heavy machine guns -- through
government checkpoints, to Robat.
</P>
<P>
Robat is believed to have 20 or more heroin labs, from which the drug is driven
in armed convoys across southern Iran to Turkey and on to Europe and America.
</P>
<P>
Sources say the Robat operations involve members of at least three Afghan
resistance parties. It is uncertain whether party officials in Quetta and
Peshawar are linked to the trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners are forbidden to enter Robat "for security reasons." Some sources
claim that the aim is to prevent outsiders from witnessing what goes on.
</P>
<P>
"It is perfectly obvious that this trafficking could not proceed without the
full knowledge of the ISI (Interservices Intelligence) and the local Pakistani
authorities," a West European diplomat says.

A SAD BUT GROWING PHENOMENON;
</P>
<P>
CHINA COPES WITH ITS UNWANTED BABIES

<TEXT>
<P>
Shen Xiaozhi, a 2-month-old foundling with a growth the size of a grapefruit on
her back, is one of the lucky ones. She is being looked after in the
well-equiped Beijing Children's Welfare Institute. But many of the thousands of
unwanted babies being left in big cities in railway stations, outside
hospitals, on docksides and even tossed on rubbish heaps cannot expect to
survive.
</P>
<P>
It is a phenomenon that has grown steadily in recent years, partly as a result
of the one-child policy but also because as social controls have loosened,
China's rural population has become more mobile.
</P>
<P>
The temptation for Chinese peasants to abandon their physically handicapped
babies in big cities where there is at least a chance of getting the right
medical care and treatment is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notes, Money Attached
</P>
<P>
"Many of the babies are found with money or notes attached to them but never
with the parents' address," said Ye Tieliang, director of the Beijing Children
Welfare Institute, the city's only state-run orphanage.
</P>
<P>
According to the People's Daily, about 50 foundlings are left at Beijing's
capacious and overcrowded railway station each year and similar numbers are
left at other major stations. Between 1986 and 1987, nearly 700 foundlings were
picked up in Canton city while an investigation in five of the province's
counties showed that 862 babies were picked up.
</P>
<P>
The babies are frequently female or suffering from Down's Syndrome, broken
backs, deafness, blindness -- or even such easily cured defects as harelips.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Many Never Survive'
</P>
<P>
Unofficial sources claimed, however, that the problem is far greater than is
being admitted with thousands of children being left in Beijing alone. "Most of
them never survive. They are usually too weak and they are an unwanted burden,"
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year the legal newspapers said that in 15 months, 25 vagrants had
been found dead at Beijing's railway station. The issue is highly sensitive and
public security officials, who are responsible for handling the unwanted
babies, declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
Ye denied a People's Daily report that his institute received 141 handicapped
foundlings last year. However, the Beijing municipal authorities have issued a
circular warning people they will face prosecution if they abandon a child, an
act that contravenes the constitution.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rewards Offered
</P>
<P>
Rewards are being offered to people who help locate parents of the foundlings.
Only 1.8% of the country's 10 million disabled children receive special care in
child welfare institutions set up in the country's urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, there are 60 state-run child-welfare institutions that can provide
reasonable service on a long-term basis to 11,000 disabled children in urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Institute appears to serve primarily handicapped children in return
for financial donations. At the Tianjin children's welfare institute, officials
say that what was originally designed for orphans has become "an abandoned
babies" collecting house.
</P>
<P>
"The cruel-hearted parents threw out their babies who were handicapped but they
had money to buy refrigerators and color TV sets, so why didn't they send these
children to hospital?" an official at Tianjin was quoted by the People's Daily.
Few of the orphans are adopted and the Tianjin children's institute says it can
no longer afford to pay for so many children's medical fees.

PRIEST'S OUSTER SILENCES HAITI'S VOICE OF THE POOR

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The expulsion of a radical slum priest from his ecclesiastic order has silenced
Haiti's most influential voice for the rights of the nation's poor.
</P>
<P>
In expelling Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the conservative Salesian Order
accused the populist Roman Catholic cleric of fomenting class warfare, calling
him a "protagonist of destabilization."
</P>
<P>
His ouster was announced Dec. 15 in a statement from Rome. Although Aristide
remains a priest, he cannot officiate at Mass or deliver sermons over church
radio.
</P>
<P>
"He has been neutralized," said sociologist Franklyn Midi.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outspoken Campaigner
</P>
<P>
Aristide, 35, a Salesian priest since 1975, has been one of the most outspoken
campaigners for social justice in a country ruled for nearly its entire
184-year existence by dictators.
</P>
<P>
He has escaped at least three attempts on his life, including a Sept. 11 attack
at his St. Jean Bosco Church in a Port-au-Prince slum in which thugs armed with
machetes, guns, clubs and spears killed 12 people and wounded at least 70
others.
</P>
<P>
One week later, rank-and-file soldiers overthrew Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy in a
coup that put Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril in power. Coup leaders said they wanted
democratic reforms and an end to state-sponsored violence, citing the church
massacre as an example.
</P>
<P>
Salesian officials expelled Aristide after he failed to obey their order to
leave Haiti by Oct. 17 and assume a new post in Canada.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular Protests
</P>
<P>
Two previous transfer orders were rescinded because of popular protests.
Thousands protested in support of Aristide for several days in October, but
there were no immediate demonstrations after the expulsion.
</P>
<P>
Aristide, who has been seen in public only once since the church massacre, has
made no public statement and has declined requests for interviews. But friends
say his morale is excellent and he might appeal the church decision.
</P>
<P>
Despite its condemnation of military brutality and human-rights abuses in
Haiti, the Catholic hierarchy has long opposed Aristide's political
proselytizing of the poor.
</P>
<P>
A proponent of liberation theology, which advocates church involvement in a
political struggle by the poor against social injustice, Aristide preaches
"active nonviolence." He urges a "real revolution" to bring democracy to Haiti,
but does not specifically propose an armed uprising.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fire and Brimstone
</P>
<P>
His pulpit style is that of a fire-and-brimstone preacher whose leading
questions prompt quick responses from the congregation. The sermons were
broadcast nationwide and earned Aristide a huge following among the urban poor
and the rural peasantry, who call the bespectacled ascetic their "prophet."
</P>
<P>
Although civic leaders and many priests applauded Aristide's crusade, the
church hierarchy apparently feared the possible consequences of radicalizing
the masses.
</P>
<P>
"The upper and middle classes, of course, have heaved a sigh of relief," Midi
said of Aristide's ouster. "They are uncomfortable when the voice of the poor
is raised too high."
</P>
<P>
"What they have not understood is that Aristide has contained the resentment of
the impoverished masses by giving it a religious form," Midi added. "He has not
sent them into the streets but drawn them into the church."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bishops Were Worried
</P>
<P>
A Salesian spokesman in Rome, Father Joseph Aubrey, told the Voice of America
that the expulsion was ordered because Haitian "bishops worried about the
results of Aristide's action."
</P>
<P>
But Father Serge Miot, secretary of Haitian Bishops Council, denied that the
council had asked the Salesians to expel Aristide.
</P>
<P>
The effective silencing of Aristide coincides with a move by Avril to tighten
army discipline after a purported Oct. 14 coup attempt. Since then, the
government has imprisoned or discharged dozens of soldiers for alleged
insubordination.
</P>
<P>
Leftist politicians have accused the government of clamping down on the most
progressive element in the army -- soldiers angered by the slow progress in
bringing about the democratic reforms Avril promised when he became president.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had Become a Symbol
</P>
<P>
It is not known what role, if any, the government had in Aristide's ouster; but
to some, the priest has become a symbol of the democratic struggle.
</P>
<P>
"Aristide was discharged from his religious order in the same way that soldiers
faithful to the Sept. 17 reform movement have been discharged from the army,"
said Paul Dejean, a Haitian author and social worker, referring to those who
participated in the coup to gain democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
"People who believe in the Gospel values of liberation, liberty and justice are
penalized and punished," he said.

'DOUBLE STANDARD' RAISES EYEBROWS IN SHIAS' CAPITAL
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA ABU-NASR, Associated Press
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BAALBEK, Lebanon
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scantily dressed dancers are long gone. The last liquor store was blown up
six years ago. This ancient Roman city now is the Lebanese capital of Shia
Muslim fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
Public drinking and dancing are forbidden now, but brief male-female unions
called "pleasure marriages" are condoned.
</P>
<P>
On the surface at least, life in Baalbek is governed by the dictates of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's stern brand of Islamic fundamentalism in Iran,
which to Western eyes appears joyless and forbidding.
</P>
<P>
Wearing makeup or jewelry in public is taboo. So is singing and dancing at
mixed gatherings because, as one woman noted, "it causes psychological
imbalance and tempts men."
</P>
<P>
But when the sun goes down and the doors are locked, the black robe-like
chadors Shia women have to wear in public are discarded in favor of shorts and
strapless tops, along with makeup and perfume.
</P>
<P>
"People think we're made of stone just because we cover ourselves with chadors.
But we're not. We're ready to do anything to please our husbands," said Selma,
a housewife.
</P>
<P>
Before Lebanon's civil war erupted in 1975, Baalbek was a cultural center where
dance and theatrical festivals were held in the breathtaking Roman
amphitheaters.
</P>
<P>
Now the ruins echo with Islamic slogans as the fundamentalists stage political
rallies there, chanting ritual denunciations of "Death to America! Death to
Israel!" The amphitheaters have also been used as mortar positions in Lebanon's
sectarian fighting.
</P>
<P>
The Shias' strict life style has drawn bitter criticism from many Lebanese,
Muslims and Christians alike who say that the fundamentalists' "double
standards" have brought Islam into disrepute.
</P>
<P>
Most Shias in Baalbek belong to Hezbollah (Party of God), which is believed to
be an umbrella for Shia kidnapers holding most of the 16 foreigners missing in
Lebanon. It's made up of zealots blindly loyal to Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
"We follow whatever Khomeini decrees. Whatever he rejects, we reject," said
Zeinab Nasser, an administrator at the women's "haouzeh," or religious center,
in Baalbek.
</P>
<P>
The practice of pleasure marriage is one of the many customs frowned on by
other Lebanese, especially moderate Shias and Sunnis.
</P>
<P>
In a pleasure marriage, a young woman who would not dare expose a curl of her
hair from under her chador can take on an unlimited number of lovers in the
name of religion.
</P>
<P>
But most of the women who take part in pleasure marriages are considered
respectable and far from promiscuous.
</P>
<P>
The practice is widespread in Iran, where the overwhelming majority of the 54
million population is Shia.
</P>
<P>
Nasser said the Prophet Mohammed sanctioned pleasure marriage, making it
acceptable for a couple to marry for a specified period that could last "for an
hour, two days, a month or as long as they desire."
</P>
<P>
"It's all perfectly legal and provisions are made for any child born after the
marriage contract expires," she explained.
</P>
<P>
She said pleasure marriage is especially practical amid Lebanon's economic
crisis because "men cannot afford a regular marriage, and let's face it, they
have physical needs.
</P>
<P>
"If these cannot be met within a permanent marriage, pleasure marriage provides
the outlet," she added. "It's much better than doing it illicitly."
</P>
<P>
No cleric is required to perform the ceremony. The woman, who should preferably
be either divorced or widowed, tells the man, "I give myself to you in
pleasure."
</P>
<P>
He responds: "I accept." And that's it.
</P>
<P>
Virgins need the consent of their parents, but they often do not seek it.
</P>
<P>
As for forms of entertainment, the fundamentalists permit classical music
"because it does not have any negative psychological effects," Nasser said.
</P>
<P>
She observed that a scientific report proved that loud music is bad for "the
nerves and the blood circulation."
</P>
<P>
Like other factions in Lebanon, where the government has collapsed, the Shias
have established their own medical and welfare systems, amply funded by Iran.
</P>
<P>
Abbas Mousavi, a Hezbollah leader, said: "Social work has become one of our
main responsibilities because of the catastrophes that have befallen Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We've founded the Imam Khomeini Hospital here, which provides free medical
treatment. There are similar centers in other Shia areas."
</P>
<P>
He noted: "We've also founded pharmacies that make a very small profit, as well
as schools, which we hope will accommodate 6,000 students in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"We've given money to needy families and bought deep-bore drills to provide
wells in remote villages, especially those we consider to have military or
political importance."
</P>
<P>
Asked about complaints on restrictions against alcohol and nightclubs, Mousavi
noted: "We're not imposing Islamic values on people. No one can say we've
raided houses where people gamble or drink."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the bombing of liquor stores and clubs, he conceded: "There were
incidents where young men acted out of Islamic zeal after witnessing aberrant
behavior. But Hezbollah is against that."

West Germans, who lead the world in per capita consumption of beer, will be
getting a guarantee of freshness this year with every brew.
</P>

Beginning today, the nation's 2,500 breweries must stamp a freshness date on
each container and guarantee the product's quality until that time, the
Bavarian Interior Ministry announced last week.

COLOMBIA'S EMERALD MINES: GREEN GOLD
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CARLOS RUEDA, Deutsche Presse-Agentur
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
BOGOTA, Colombia
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 150 miles from Bogota lie the mines of Muzo and Coscuez, the biggest
emerald deposits in the world. The car drive from the Colombian capital over a
potholed track takes eight to 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
To Santa Barbara, a small town 5 miles from the mining centers, the land is a
lush green. Thereafter, the terrain is a gray bleakness. The wild mountain
peaks are covered from morning until evening in a cloak of mist as if nature
seeks to hide its treasures.
</P>
<P>
The houses in Santa Barbara are made of wood, despite the millions of pesos to
be made in the town every day. There are no hotels, not even hostels for the
simple traveler. Yet the finest and most expensive Scotch flows, and fortunes
are squandered in the town's bars and dives.
</P>
<P>
The neighboring town of Muzo usually has about 5,000 residents, but during an
emerald boom -- and that happens whenever a new seam is discovered -- the
population soars to 20,000.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warnings Issued
</P>
<P>
For those unacquainted with the land, the journey into the mining zone can be
extremely dangerous. Tourists are warned to stay away. The area has been dubbed
the "Land of 1,001 Nights" and the "Devil's Caldron."
</P>
<P>
Wild rags-to-riches stories go the rounds in Muzo and Coscuez, where
millionaires have been made overnight. Thousands of adventurers have lost their
lives in bloody fighting among themselves. Numerous crosses planted by the
roadside or dotting the fields are silent testimony to the violence.
</P>
<P>
The emerald is a form of beryl, a mineral found principally in granite and
granite pegmatites. It is prospected in its pure form as a precious stone and
is green or blue-green in color.
</P>
<P>
"The most valuable are the so-called 'oil drops' and 'water eyes,' veritable
masterpieces of nature for which vast sums are paid," explained a jeweler in
Bogota.
</P>
<P>
The precious stones prospected in Muzo and Coscuez are sent to Bogota to be
valued by experts. Shine, purity and color determine the price.
</P>
<P>
Emerald mines can also be found in Brazil, Africa, Australia, India and the
Soviet Union. Japan even produces synthetic emeralds.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Owns Resources
</P>
<P>
The deposits in Colombia were mined in pre-Columbian times. The present
official prospector, the Compania Esmeraldas de Colombia, holds the concession
from the state, which owns all mineral resources in the country.
</P>
<P>
The question of how much emerald is actually found in Colombia each year is
difficult to answer, as great quantities of the precious stone disappear onto
the black market.
</P>
<P>
Official figures put the annual legal export of emeralds at $36.3 million.
However, insiders reckon that between $100 million and $150 million worth of
Colombian emeralds are marketed each year.
</P>
<P>
The price of the stone depends on many factors, including ever-changing supply
and demand, and the fluctuating rate of the dollar. Prospective purchasers are
advised not to buy from strangers in the street, but to go to a respected
jeweler.
</P>
<P>
Distinguishing a fake from the real thing is not an easy task, even for the
experts. Many a traveler has returned home with worthless glass instead of a
valuable gem.

WOMAN DIES TRYING TO GET INTO HOME VIA WINDOW
</P>

<P>
DAYTON, Ohio

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A neighbor saw what he thought was a department store mannequin hanging upside
down from the window of the house next door and ignored it. It turned out to be
a woman who died of exposure while trying to break into her home.
</P>
<P>
The body of Sherry Gaydos, 34, clad only in her underwear and socks, was found
Wednesday by the neighbor, hanging upside down with her left leg wedged in a
pantry window at her home.
</P>
<P>
Gaydos' husband, John, was asleep inside the house when the incident occurred,
unaware of his wife's struggle for life, police said.
</P>
<P>
"It took two policemen to pry the window off her foot," John Gaydos said. "She
hung upside down by her ankle and froze to death."
</P>
<P>
Gaydos said his wife left home while he slept Tuesday evening and drove the car
to the end of the alley, where the vehicle struck a telephone pole.
</P>
<P>
Sherry Gaydos was taken unconscious to a Dayton hospital for treatment, then
was released or left on her own, her husband said. In the meantime, her car --
with the keys inside -- was towed out of the alley, he said.
</P>
<P>
Police told Gaydos that their investigation showed that his wife took a cab
from the hospital to their home around 1 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With her keys gone, Sherry Gaydos apparently tried to force her way into a
pantry window at the rear of the building and became trapped after the window
closed on her foot, her husband said.
</P>
<P>
Gaydos said his wife apparently had removed some of her clothes "because she
was trying to be thin enough to get through the small window."
</P>
<P>
"It was very small. No human could really have gotten into it," he said.
</P>
<P>
It appeared Sherry Gaydos tried to boost herself through the window using a
metal garbage can. The can was tipped over beneath the window.
</P>
<P>
Wilma Johnson, the neighbor who discovered the woman's snow-covered body, said
she noticed the body hanging from the window about 9 a.m. Wednesday but thought
it was a department store mannequin. When it still was there several hours
later, she investigated.
</P>
<P>
Gaydos said he was at home while his wife was trying to enter the house, having
fallen asleep on the couch. He said he awoke at about 11:30 and went to bed but
was not aware that his wife had left.
</P>
<P>
Dave Lett, an investigator with the Montgomery County coroner's office, said
the official cause of death was not determined pending toxicology tests.
</P>
<P>
"With this type of death, a woman hanging out of the window by one leg in her
underclothing in severe weather, you question that kind of death," Lett said.
"But at this point we did not find any foul play."

ERITREAN REBEL CAMPAIGN BACKED BY HIDDEN FACTORIES, ETHIOPIAN POWS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP WILLIAMS, United Press International
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
AROTA, Ethiopia
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is 11 p.m. White-coated technicians shuffle in surgical clogs from tubes to
beakers, inspecting the quality of anti-tuberculosis pills rattling out of a
molding machine at a rate of 40,000 per hour.
</P>
<P>
This isn't the late shift. It is the only shift at "EPLF Pharmaceuticals," a
lab housed inside four giant shipping crates 300 miles from the nearest
independent electricity supply.
</P>
<P>
Outside in a remote valley in Eritrea in northern Ethiopia, crickets and frogs
join buzzing mosquitoes and the noise of foxes chasing African hares over the
boulders. Civet cats and gray owls watch from stunted, moonlit trees.
</P>
<P>
Inside, technicians of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front produce no less
than 37 varieties of pills, capsules, ointments and liquids to be packed into
brown bottles marked "EPLF Drug Production and Research" over a logo of a cobra
wrapped round a pharmacist's pestle.
</P>
<P>
The 5-year-old drug venture is just one of many backup industries supporting
the EPLF's 27-year-old guerrilla war for independence from Ethiopia. They
produce souped-up automobile engines, machine tools, truck bodies, molded
shoes, textbooks, pamphlets, flour-milling machines, macaroni, spaghetti and
even sanitary towels.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety of Darkness
</P>
<P>
Like the watch and electrical repair shops and the tank and truck garages, they
are heavily camouflaged and operate under the safety of darkness, free of the
threat of bombardment from Ethiopian MIG warplanes.
</P>
<P>
All are staffed by trained personnel, many graduates, working without salary as
their contribution to the massive, centralized war effort.
</P>
<P>
The pharmaceutical factory is the centerpiece of the key EPLF doctrine of
self-reliance and self-sufficiency, forced on it by years of isolation from
external support.
</P>
<P>
Basic chemicals are imported from Europe to make a range of the most frequently
used preparations against diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. The EPLF
factories produce about 40% of the basic list of 187 EPLF-approved drugs
covering tetracycline antibiotics, sulfanilamides, vitamins, iron supplements,
anti-parasitic, paracetamol and aspirin compounds.
</P>
<P>
Even limited current production is reckoned to be worth more than $750,000 a
year -- $310,000 in sterile solutions for drips and major surgery alone.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Shipping Containers
</P>
<P>
Plans are afoot to boost capacity -- with the aid of more shipping containers
and plentiful mud -- to 80% of total drug needs.
</P>
<P>
The laboratory and its integrated research department, run by an Eritrean
pharmacist trained in Ethiopia and the United States, is hidden conveniently
close to the EPLF's main hospital at Arota in northern Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The hospital is a huge complex, able to treat 800 to 1,000 patients in small
units dug into rock, camouflaged and spaced for safety along 5 miles of narrow
valley. It links a network of provincial hospitals, civilian clinics and medic
stations concealed near the battle fronts.
</P>
<P>
About 99% of EPLF, civilian and Ethiopian prisoner casualties can be treated
for almost every kind of ailment and wound in this health system.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring valleys hold mechanical and electrical shops equipped with lathes
and specialist machinery to service and substitute even the heaviest industrial
plant for both civilian and military needs. That includes giant generating
units to supply basic power.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Italian Moulding Machine
</P>
<P>
Footwear was a headache until Eritreans working abroad donated an Italian PVC
injection molding machine eight years ago. It now cranks out 100 hot pairs of
black plastic sandals an hour.
</P>
<P>
The plastic base granules are imported but -- saving a penny as ever -- 20% of
the plastic input is recycled from machine waste and old sandals collected from
fighters in the field. Black was not a color chosen on considerations of
fashion.
</P>
<P>
"White wouldn't do for camouflage reasons," said a sandal worker. "Black is the
most convenient in that respect."
</P>
<P>
Italian colonists who founded an Eritrean state in the late 19th Century left
little transport infrastructure. Most major Eritrean towns are connected by
poor dirt roads, but these are largely off limits to Eritrean supply convoys
because of possible land mines and the threat from Ethiopian warplanes.
</P>
<P>
Movements of huge amounts of munitions and tons of gasoline required
alternative networks. In physical terms, this was probably the greatest
challenge and is the greatest concrete achievement of the Eritrean liberation
movement.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hostile, Rocky Landscapes
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of miles of tracks capable of taking large trailer trucks have been
driven through hostile, rocky landscapes. Most are hidden in dry, winding river
beds, but shortcuts have been driven over 6,000-foot mountains with hairpin
turns that would dizzy a Swiss.
</P>
<P>
"In the early days we cut those passes with sweat, shovels and picks," said a
veteran fighter. "These days, it's a bit different."
</P>
<P>
The rebels now have bulldozers, grading machines and blasting powder,
supplemented by the combined muscle of some 12,000 Ethiopian prisoners of war.
Like the stiff-lipped Britons of the "Bridge over the River Kwai" movie, they
appear to take a perverse pride in their contribution to the Eritrean revolt.
</P>
<P>
Garages dot the supply routes. They have vulcanizing units, welding and brazing
tackle, compressors and machine lathes capable of turning out replacement
pistons and rings with critical tolerances.
</P>
<P>
Some specialize like Western car dealers in particular models such as Toyota
Landcruisers, olive green four-wheel-drive Moskovitches or monolithic Soviet
trucks designed to haul outsize field guns on tires 2 feet thick.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chipped Coke Bottles
</P>
<P>
The parsimonious efficiency of the EPLF backup operation, in which precious
little is thrown away, defies cataloguing. Scraps of waste bread piled on
sheets outside every field kitchen are not for the birds -- dried, they form
the must and yeast for fermentation of a heady wheat beer served in chipped
Coke bottles.
</P>
<P>
In the ruined central Eritrean town of Nacfa, flattened by 10 years of almost
daily bombing and now a gaunt symbol of the resistance, a 133-millimeter shell
case hung on a string with a stick on a tumbledown wall is a makeshift alarm
bell.
</P>
<P>
Like swords turned into plowshares, finned back sections of huge unexploded
bombs form mountings for drills and metal cutters. Rocket casings become
charcoal grills and cooking knives. Door jambs, window frames, bunker roofing
and furniture invariably are fashioned from wooden ammunition boxes.
</P>
<P>
Donated burlap grain sacks are transformed into curtains and rugs, sun awnings,
roof insulation and false ceilings. USAID sacks are particularly popular. They
are often made from a close-woven, almost waterproof plastic and make warm
mattresses.
</P>
<P>
At the swarming Ethiopian POW camps, bored but grateful inmates fritter away
hot hours around noon with playing cards cut from pasteboard ammunition
packing.
</P>
<P>
As the sun cools they stir and, helped enthusiastically by rebel guards as sick
as their charges with a monotonous dry diet devoid of anything fresh or green,
they tend cabbage, capsicum, courgette and spinach developed on EPLF
agricultural research stations.
</P>
<P>
The golden revolutionary rule is that nothing comes on a plate. The Eritreans
have no alternative to self-reliance.

FROM CUCUMBERS TO CAVIAR;
</P>
<P>
DEPARTMENT STORE EATERIES HAVE GONE TRENDY TO ATTRACT BUSY SHOPPERS.

When caterer David Zafferelli joined the throngs at Nordstrom's new downtown
San Francisco store in October, he dropped $150 on two flannel shirts and
another $150 for bubbly and Beluga caviar at the store's Champagne Exchange
bar.
</P>
<P>
"We just thought that was as much fun as shopping," he said. "I'll always go
for any excuse to drink champagne and eat caviar."
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, shoppers who stop to nosh at department stores are finding chic,
newfangled eateries in place of the proper tearooms and restaurants of their
childhoods. Whereas patrons in the early part of the century sipped tea and
nibbled cucumber sandwiches, customers of upscale department stores today are
more likely to have espresso and cookies or Cornish game hen and Chardonnay or
mesquite-grilled chicken and pasta salad.
</P>
<P>
The shifts in department store food service reflect a fundamental change in the
philosophy of shoppers, observers say. In the old days, people would make
shopping an all-day event, with a leisurely lunch or tea break built in. Today,
with time-starved but hard-working baby boomers hankering for service and
quality, the right restaurant can serve not only as a lure but also as an
incentive to linger in the store. And shoppers such as Zafferelli have proved
willing to spend liberally for the ambiance.
</P>
<P>
Of course, old-fashioned tearooms still exist, and some, such as those at
Bullocks Wilshire and Bullock's Pasadena, are thriving, particularly at holiday
time. But many stores in recent years have turned these genteel anachronisms
into stylish cafes or bistros where customers come year-round just to dine,
never mind the shopping.
</P>
<P>
"The '80s has brought us into a whole different era," said Robert J. Nyman,
president of George Lang Corp., a New York firm that develops restaurant
concepts. "Most stores today are using food service as an amenity that has to
do with the total marketing of the store."
</P>
<P>
With department stores undergoing sweeping changes of late, many retailers,
particularly downtown merchants that must compete with ubiquitous suburban
malls, have strived to hold onto or devise unique operations that make them a
destination. Restaurants often fill the bill, even if they don't contribute
heartily to the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
At the new Nordstrom in San Francisco, for example, the marble-topped champagne
bar has become a draw for upscale customers, as has an authentic English pub
modeled on one at Harrods in London. At the flagship Bloomingdale's in
Manhattan, the premier dining spot among half a dozen eateries is Le Train
Bleu, a re-creation of a luxury Orient Express-type dining car. The Dayton
Hudson department stores in the Midwest are expanding a Marketplace Foods
concept that offers carry-out pasta, stir-fried dishes, freshly baked breads
and frozen yogurt to busy downtown workers.
</P>
<P>
Unlike their tearoom predecessors, which usually were situated in a store's
highest reaches, these food outlets are often stashed next to fashion
departments. And they are a far cry from the Formica-topped counters prevalent
at five-and-dime and discount stores.
</P>
<P>
"The opportunities for food in department stores are the best they've been in
over 20 years," said John D. Lovelace, central director of food services for
Dayton Hudson in Minneapolis. "People eat every day, but they don't shop every
day."
</P>
<P>
Food service has gone in and out of favor with retailers over the last few
decades, and even today retailers' philosophies differ widely.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very mixed bag," said Charles J. Leven, senior vice president,
director of operations at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York. "Some companies are
cutting back, a few are expanding." Saks intends to open its first restaurant
at the flagship Manhattan store next year, Leven said, after customers clamored
for food service.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Quick Food' Concepts
</P>
<P>
Until about 1950, large department stores catering to the carriage trade
typically used a chunk of their space for tearooms. In the 1960s, the
popularity of such rooms declined, and many started losing money. As real
estate became more valuable in the 1970s, merchants began devoting the space to
clothing and other items that were more profitable. At the same time, many
stores were going into suburban malls that had abundant sit-down restaurants or
fast-food outlets in so-called food courts.
</P>
<P>
Then women went to work in record numbers and the population became more health
and diet conscious. Fewer people had the time or inclination to spend a
leisurely afternoon at their favorite tearoom. That gave rise to a variety of
"quick food" concepts in stores catering to customers for whom money was less
of an object than convenience and quality.
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom plunged into the food business 10 years ago after having leased space
for years to a small chain of restaurants. It now has 70 food outlets in 58
stores, most under the names Espresso Bar and Cafe Express, featuring fresh
soups and salads.
</P>
<P>
Faced with having to attract shoppers to a seedy location three blocks from
Union Square in San Francisco, Nordstrom decided to go in for some culinary
theatrics in its newest store.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to create little pockets of fun," said Jim Dickinson, general
manager of the Seattle-based chain's restaurant division. "We also wanted to
create a reason for people to stay in our stores rather than get out to our
competitors."
</P>
<P>
The Pub, strategically placed next to the men's department, is modeled on the
Green Man at Harrods in London, an innovative retailer that houses about 20
food outlets and a massive food hall where Londoners and tourists alike buy
pricey groceries. The Nordstrom room features stools covered with forest green
leather, a plank floor made of Kentucky barn wood, a healthy selection of
imported and domestic beers and television monitors.
</P>
<P>
If the Pub idea proves successful, Dickinson said, Nordstrom plans to expand it
into other new stores nationwide. The chain also is considering a "bread basket
concept" that would sell freshly baked goods and small open-face sandwiches,
already dubbed Nordwiches.
</P>
<P>
The store's Champagne Exchange was designed to offer a high return. It takes up
less space by far than would a traditional tearoom yet affords a high markup on
its caviar and 103 champagne varieties. The concept "enables the customer to
spend a lot of money," Dickinson said. "We do find, particularly in San
Francisco, it doesn't bother people to be drinking a $9 glass of champagne."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lots of Flash
</P>
<P>
The chain also this holiday rolled out its Nordstrom Select Pantry, a selection
of gift food items developed in its restaurants.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Dickinson said, Nordstrom's restaurant operations account for 1.5% of
the chain's annual sales (which last year totaled nearly $2 billion) yet 22% of
its transactions, indicating that food tabs are generally far lower than those
for other purchases.
</P>
<P>
Bloomingdale's flagship store in New York also goes in for selling sizzle along
with its steaks. "The restaurants at Bloomingdale's have evolved into unique
concepts in tune with the eating public," said Will Hellemeyer, director of
food service. "We are what people expect of restaurants in the '80s . . . and
not what they expect to find in a department store restaurant."
</P>
<P>
After renovating the housewares department several years ago, the store was
left with a long, narrow space on an intermediate level between two floors. A
store designer came up with the idea of copying a luxury dining car, complete
with green velvet chairs, white linen tablecloths and brass chandeliers.
</P>
<P>
Le Train Bleu (named for a midnight blue engine), which opened in 1978, is "a
Continental restaurant that competes with restaurants on the East Side of
Manhattan and is rated in dining guides," Hellemeyer said. With seating for 64,
the restaurant features such specialties as calf's liver with cassis and
shallots, grilled Cornish game hen stuffed with foie gras and wild rice and
grilled swordfish with sun-dried tomato butter. Average tab: $20.
</P>
<P>
Among other Bloomie's food service operations, Hellemeyer said, are Forty
Carrots, a "healthy food" restaurant in which the store years ago introduced
frozen yogurt to the New York market; Showtime Cafe, an upscale cafeteria
similar to Cafe Casino, and Espresso Bar, "a Euro-chic Italian cafe" offering
desserts, fresh pastas, salads and wines.
</P>
<P>
The decision whether to offer food service is usually based on a store's
location and bottom line. Store officials would not talk about their
restaurants' financial results, but they acknowledged that food service is an
expensive proposition.
</P>
<P>
The food business "in general has lower margins than most other merchandise in
a department store," said Ken Stevens, a consultant with the Los Angeles office
of McKinsey &amp; Co. It comes down to a trade-off, with the retailer
determining whether the intangible benefits of offering the service outweigh
the reduced profitability.
</P>
<P>
At Marshall Field's in Chicago, for instance, the legendary Walnut Room -- a
restaurant in the old tradition -- is not considered a big profit maker "other
than that it's a big draw," said Homer G. Sharp, head of central display.
"Obviously, people go shopping while they're here."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some End Food Service
</P>
<P>
With a typical sit-down eatery costing between $500,000 and $1 million to
install, many retailers, May Co. California among them, are inclined to put
restaurants into free-standing stores but not into those mall locations served
by a food court. Another consideration is space: New department stores tend to
be far smaller than the huge stores of years past and have less space to spare
for low-return businesses.
</P>
<P>
Bonwit Teller, a fashion specialty store, has phased out its food business.
Until its purchase by May Department Stores two years ago, Robinson's was
making a big push into food service. Now, it has only three food outlets
chain-wide, all of them leased.
</P>
<P>
In designing its newest stores, including those in Los Angeles and Palm Desert,
Bullock's left out restaurants. And when the chain remodeled its Santa Ana
location, the restaurant was removed.
</P>
<P>
The tearoom in Bullock's Pasadena, according to James B. Brooks, the store's
general manager, is the chain's most profitable food service operation and
lately has been expanding its successful banquet business. Even so, the tearoom
recently eliminated its evening food service, primarily because of increased
restaurant competition in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest proponents of food is Dayton Hudson Department Store Co.,
which claims to have the largest upscale food service among U.S. department
stores, serving 12 million patrons a year.
</P>
<P>
When Lovelace, the food service director, joined the company in 1982, he
immediately set about developing new "upscale fast-food" concepts and
transforming the company's traditional sit-down restaurants "to meet the needs
of the customer of the '80s."
</P>
<P>
Among other operations, the company came up with Yogurt Express, which
generates a hefty $1,000 in sales per square foot (compared to about $200 for
non-food merchandise) and is being rolled out to several of the company's 37
stores; 700 Express, designed to serve customers quality fast food within 10
minutes, and a combination of five quick food concepts that replaced the
flagship Minneapolis store's traditional Sky Room and quickly tripled sales.
The company is also expanding its 4-year-old Marketplace Foods, similar to
Macy's Cellar in New York, with a substantial carry-out area.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting customers' rapidly changing palates, ethnic foods are playing a
bigger role in Dayton Hudson's offerings. Forget the cling peach halves,
cottage cheese and iceberg lettuce leaves of yore. New menus offer Morocco
salad, made with boneless chicken breast and couscous ($6), and smoked salmon
with radicchio, bibb lettuce, avocado, grapefruit, chopped egg and caviar,
Dayton Hudson's most expensive salad at $7.
</P>
<P>
The Broadway, too, has found that its customers' changing tastes have forced it
to adapt quickly to new trends. It recently closed a traditional sit-down
restaurant at its Brea Mall store in favor of a deli service with lighter fare.
"We . . . have seen a really remarkable response," said Richard F. Clayton,
president.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Food Is Fashion'
</P>
<P>
Unlike Bullock's, the Broadway has put food service operations into its newest
stores, but it also recently closed restaurants in Beverly Center and Baldwin
Hills where it "couldn't come up with a formula that worked," Clayton said. The
43-store chain now operates 24 food facilities, serving more than 2 million
diners a year.
</P>
<P>
"That's a lot of transactions," Clayton said. "It's important because we touch
a lot of customers."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, food service, once the province of large department stores, has also
spread to smaller specialty apparel boutiques such as Koala Blue, with its
Australian-style milk bars; Fred Segal, which has restaurants at stores in
Santa Monica and on Melrose Avenue; Merry Go Round, a chain selling young men's
and women's apparel that is testing a '50s-style diner and soda fountain in a
store in Denver, and Barneys, an exclusive women's clothier in Manhattan that
has Le Cafe, a buffet and bistro bar with about 90 seats.
</P>
<P>
To Dickinson of Nordstrom, the merging of menus and merchandise makes sense.
"We consider ourselves a fashion retail store, and we believe food is fashion,"
he said. "There is tremendous opportunity for good dining."

Oil from a ruptured Shell Oil Co. pipeline floated down the Mississippi River
and forced cleanup crews to work round the clock to try to limit effects of the
spill, a Shell spokesman in St. Louis said. Missouri Department of Natural
Resources officials said the spill -- the worst in the state's history -- began
Dec. 24 when a pipeline at Vienna, Mo., ruptured, allowing at least 336,000
gallons of dichlorobenzene, a petroleum product, to flow into the Gasconade
River. The spill has not caused problems with water supplies, but state
officials said they could not measure the long-term effects on fish and
wildlife in the Gasconade, Missouri and Mississippi rivers. Shell spokesman
Tony Canino said that the cold weather prevented the oil from clinging to the
river banks.

The American Legion's top recruiter in California turned in more than 200 phony
membership registrations, including ones for a former German soldier and people
who were dead, according to a Legion report. Costa Mesa Post Cmdr. Robert
Hanson could be expelled from the American Legion, said state Cmdr. Andrew J.
Steffanic. A three-member Legion committee issued its findings in a 13-page
report signed by Steffanic. Hanson, 67, declined to discuss the report, but
said, "I am contemplating legal action." The state American Legion awarded
Hanson its Recruiter of the Year award after Hanson submitted 801 new
memberships between July 1, 1987, and the 1988 convention. But the
investigation found that only 18 of the supposed applicants paid dues by check,
while Hanson wrote about 25 checks to the Costa Mesa post for $8,249.60 from
his own account. The investigation began after national headquarters received
inquiries from people wondering why they were receiving the American Legion
Magazine. Hanson told state Legion officials that the 801 membership
applications were stolen Aug. 26 when someone broke into his car.

A missing teen-ager who authorities had stopped looking for over the protest of
his parents was in fair condition after he was found wandering and disoriented
in the Cleveland National Forest. Andrew Campbell, 15, of rural Guatay had been
missing six days when he was found Friday in an oak grove by a father and son
who had gone for a drive in the San Diego County backcountry. Campbell was
suffering from minor frostbite.

Anti-terrorist police in London arrested several people in connection with the
discovery two weeks ago of a major IRA bomb factory in the city. Police would
not say how many people were rounded up or give further details of the
operation. One man was arrested earlier after police found an apartment in
south London full of bomb-making equipment and more than 100 pounds of Semtex
explosives of the sort used by Irish Republican Army guerrillas fighting to end
British rule in Northern Ireland. He was charged with conspiracy to cause
explosions in Britain likely to endanger life.

A runaway commuter train barreled through the Bavarian countryside for 12 1/2
miles after the engineer left it unattended to go to the bathroom, but forgot
to set the brake, officials said. The train, which had no passengers at the
time, finally was intentionally derailed. No one was hurt as the train traveled
from Ebersberg to Wasserburg in upper Bavaria, roaring through 20 regular
passenger stops during its 20-minute run, averaging 37 m.p.h., police added.
The train was at the end of its usual commuter run.

Two men hired to monitor the performance of lottery ticket computers sued the
California Lottery, complaining that officials ignored reports that computer
problems were underreported. In the Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit, Emmitt
A. Allison and Randy Troxel alleged that they were placed on administrative
leave and reassigned in September after they took their complaints to the state
controller's office. State lottery officials have said the allegations were
investigated and were unfounded. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and a
court order forbidding lottery officials from destroying documents supporting
Allison's and Troxel's findings.

HOMELESS FAMILIES LEAVE SQUALID HOTEL
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scrambling to meet its New Year's Eve deadline, New York City moved the last of
448 homeless families from Manhattan's squalid Martinique Hotel. Located near
Macy's department store, the turn-of-the-century hotel at Broadway and 32nd
Street had become a national symbol of the problems faced by those too poor to
afford housing. Faced with the threat of a federal funds cutoff and political
pressure, Mayor Edward I. Koch's Administration pledged to close one of its 42
welfare hotels by year's end. Koch has pledged to empty all the welfare hotels
by July, 1990. The Martinique, where the city paid $1,800 per family, was
closed first because it was "emblematic" of the conditions in other welfare
hotels, said John Beckman, a city Human Resources Administration spokesman.
Some of the relocated families were taken to newly rehabilitated apartments.
Others were transfered to other city-run facilities for the homeless. The
Martinique became a welfare hotel 15 years ago and at its height housed about
500 adults and 1,500 children. It once featured a fashionable dancehall and
popular nightclub.

More than 500 Tibetan university students defied a ban on demonstations in
Lhasa and marched to the regional government headquarters calling for a
"peaceful solution to the Tibetan problem." Tibetan and foreign sources said
that the demonstrators from Lhasa University encountered no resistance from the
massive Chinese police force in the capital and that there was no violence. The
demonstration was in sharp contrast with an anti-Chinese, pro-independence
rally Dec. 10 in which police fired on unarmed Tibetan Buddhist monks and
onlookers, killing as many as eight people.

IN SEARCH OF AN IDENTITY;

Dick Haddon's church has an identity problem.
</P>
<P>
"I tell people that the First United Methodist Church of Gardena is not in
Gardena," the Rev. Haddon said, "and people just kind of stare in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
"This is Gardena, but it's not. Even the post office says 'Gardena,' but the
reality is, we do not live in Gardena. . . . If we had a fire . . . the
response would come from the city of Los Angeles."
</P>
<P>
That is a complicated fact of life in Harbor Gateway, the 8-mile long,
4-block-wide umbilical cord acquired at the turn of the century to link Los
Angeles to its port.
</P>
<P>
In a city where community names conjure up images -- Venice, Silver Lake, Boyle
Heights -- Harbor Gateway draws a blank.
</P>
<P>
Bounded on the west by Gardena and Torrance and on the east by Carson and
unincorporated county land, the area was for decades known as the "city strip,"
the "shoestring strip" or, simply, "the strip."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Area Rechristened
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, the Los Angeles City Council rechristened the area to try to
bring a sense of identity and community pride to its citizens -- some of whom
do not even know they live in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Harbor Gateway lacks much of what makes a community a community -- no central
business district, no civic center or gathering place, no library branch, no
police station and, as Haddon noted, no post office. Its largest park is a
cemetery. And, despite the new name, mailing addresses of residents remain
unchanged. They still say Torrance or Gardena, not Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, this leaves some people confused.
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'Look, my mailing address is Gardena,' " reported Gene Painter, the
city of Gardena's superintendent of human services who said he does not turn
away Harbor Gateway residents who ask for help. "Strange as it may seem, they
don't know where they live."
</P>
<P>
Optician Chris Toughill joined the Torrance Chamber of Commerce when he opened
his shop in a Harbor Gateway strip mall, and his neighbors did the same. It
wasn't until the Torrance mayor declined to attend their grand opening,
Toughill said, that the merchants discovered that they were in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Even the young toughs of the Gardena 13 gang, interviewed while hanging out on
a Harbor Gateway street corner, insisted they were standing in Gardena.
</P>
<P>
In population, Harbor Gateway is tied with Westwood as Los Angeles'
second-fastest growing area. Sylmar is first. Between 1980 and 1986, according
to Los Angeles Planning Department estimates, Harbor Gateway's population
increased 15.6%, from 30,238 to 34,951.
</P>
<P>
A drive through the Gateway is like a trip from the city to the suburbs. On the
north end, which begins at El Segundo Boulevard, there are apartments needing
repair, gang graffiti on walls and single-family homes with barred windows. The
southern end -- which stops at Sepulveda Boulevard, where Harbor City begins --
is punctuated by newly built strip malls, condominiums and well-manicured
lawns.
</P>
<P>
Property values follow a similar pattern, with the lowest prices in the north.
Home values in nearby Torrance or Gardena, however, are considerably higher.
Real estate agents report that a house in Harbor Gateway might sell for as much
as $50,000 less than one across the street in another community.
</P>
<P>
Agents attribute the difference to better city services, particularly in
Torrance, which has its own schools.
</P>
<P>
"The minute you mention Los Angeles," said Gardena real estate agent John
Warner, "it frightens . . . people away. It's just one of those things. Homes
have always been cheaper over there (Harbor Gateway)."
</P>
<P>
Said resident Betty Roy: "I hate to be known to live in the strip. When my
friends ask where I live, I tell them Torrance."
</P>
<P>
Indeed, four years after the name change -- in spite of spiffy blue-and-white
signs that declare "Harbor Gateway" below the Los Angeles city seal -- those
who live and work there say they still feel betwixt and between, not fully a
part of Los Angeles, Harbor Gateway or the bordering cities.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'In Limbo'
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they complain that their new moniker has not brought with it what
they really want: more attention from city officials, better services such as
street cleaning and tree trimming and, above all, increased police protection.
</P>
<P>
"We're like in limbo," said Roy, a longtime resident of the Gateway's southern
end. "We're not really Torrance and we're not really Carson. . . . We're only
here because Los Angeles needs this little piece of land to attach to the
harbor. Nobody cares about us. . . . We're like the forgotten people."
</P>
<P>
For Sylvia Figueroa, life on the border means a daily struggle at It's a
Miracle, the Mexican pizza parlor she opened a year ago at Gardena Boulevard
and Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
The city of Gardena is across the street, and the differences are stark. On the
Gardena side, Gardena Boulevard -- that city's main business thoroughfare -- is
getting a face lift. The street is clean, and the trees are neatly trimmed.
City officials are offering grants to business owners for renovations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood Contrasts
</P>
<P>
Across the street in Los Angeles, the trees are scraggly and overgrown,
vagrants sleep in a littered vacant lot, liquor stores abound and the Gardena
13 gang seems to own the corner.
</P>
<P>
"The other side there's no drunk people, no people looking for drugs," said
Figueroa, who sweeps her sidewalk regularly. "The other side is so clean. Even
the sidewalk is clean.
</P>
<P>
"You see the street?" she asked, pointing to a pile of litter. "That's
terrible."
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who represents the area,
conceded that the Gateway is not getting its share of services.
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to get a library in there, because no matter where you put a
library in the Gateway, you only serve a limited number of city residents," she
said. "It's difficult to get a street cleaning service on a regular basis
because they have to come from somewhere else to get there. . . . It's not like
having a nice, round community where you have something in the middle and it
serves everybody around it."
</P>
<P>
The United Way apparently agrees. In March, the umbrella agency's
Harbor/Southeast division declared Harbor Gateway an "under-served geographic
area," citing "real gaps in law enforcement" and social services.
</P>
<P>
The declaration is part of a long-term plan by the United Way to upgrade Harbor
Gateway by organizing neighborhood leaders to form nonprofit programs for
residents.
</P>
<P>
A citizens group, chaired by Haddon, is setting goals for the project,
apparently marking the first time that community leaders around the Gateway
have come together to talk about the area's problems. The minister and some
others agree that the first goal should be improving community pride and
cohesiveness to create political clout.
</P>
<P>
To do that, residents must reverse 82 years of history.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, since the so-called Shoestring Strip Annexation of Dec. 26,
1906, Harbor Gateway residents have somehow coalesced into five distinct
neighborhoods. From north to south, their rough boundaries are El Segundo
Boulevard to Rosecrans Avenue; Rosecrans to Redondo Beach Boulevard; Redondo
Beach to Artesia Boulevard; Artesia to 190th Street; and 190th Street to
Sepulveda Boulevard. The east-west boundaries of the three northern
neighborhoods are Vermont Avenue and Figueroa Street, while Western and
Normandie avenues bound the two in the south.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Harbor Gateway is a racially mixed, middle-income area, with an
estimated median household income of $30,431 and a population that is 48.4%
white, 13.2% black, 16.5% Asian and 21.8% other racial groups, according to the
1980 census, the most recent statistics available.
</P>
<P>
Latinos -- whose numbers are not tallied as part of the racial breakdown in the
1980 census -- are Harbor Gateway's largest minority group, accounting for
32.9% of the overall population, according to census data.
</P>
<P>
However, the picture changes when the area is more closely examined.
Demographic statistics show that the various Gateway neighborhoods often
resemble adjacent communities more closely than they do one another.
</P>
<P>
For example, the two Gateway neighborhoods near south South-Central Los Angeles
and Compton have the heaviest concentration of blacks, 44.7%. Whites make up
23.6% of those two neighborhoods, which extend north from Redondo Beach
Boulevard, and Asians make up 6.9%. The estimated median household income there
is $27,453.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Make-Up of Community
</P>
<P>
But in the strip's midsection, from Artesia Boulevard to 190th Street, the
population reflects that of the southern end of Gardena, which is heavily
Asian. There, the black population is minuscule -- just 0.4% -- with most of
the population split between whites, 48.1%, and Asians, 44.8%. Estimated
household income in this section jumps dramatically, to $44,498.
</P>
<P>
And south of 190th Street, approaching predominantly white Torrance, the white
population jumps even higher, to 66.3%, while the Asian population dips to 8.6%
and the number of blacks rises slightly, to 2%. Median household income is
$27,607.
</P>
<P>
Although it is primarily residential, the Gateway also includes a burgeoning
business district at the San Diego and Harbor freeways, where, according to the
California Department of Transportation, 500,000 cars drive by each day, making
it the second-busiest intersection in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
The so-called 190th Street Corridor is a major drawing card for commercial
developers, who have built about 5 million square feet of office space there in
the last eight years. Gleaming high-rises with pleasant landscaping have
replaced a Shell oil refinery and manufacturing plants.
</P>
<P>
"We sort of had a shift from the Industrial Age to the Information Age," said
Howard Mann, president of Andrex Development Co., one of the area's major
developers.
</P>
<P>
Mann predicts that the move away from industrial to commercial uses will help
upgrade nearby areas by attracting home buyers who hold high-paying jobs in
what he calls Harbor Gateway's "urban cluster." Already, he is planning a
restaurant to meet that market, based on an analysis that, he said, "found that
the average income per household within a 5-mile radius of this intersection is
$50,000."
</P>
<P>
Dining in elegance, however, is certainly not a priority farther north in
Harbor Gateway, where large concentrations of undocumented Latinos residents
are struggling to get by.
</P>
<P>
A study by the United Way found that illegal Latino immigrants are the "most
under-served" group in the Gateway.
</P>
<P>
Haddon and other local leaders said their presence also makes it difficult to
form neighborhood coalitions because illegal aliens fear they will attract
unwanted attention from immigration authorities if they participate in
community affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Their need is to be invisible," the minister said, "and that does not make for
a good community."
</P>
<P>
Haddon is particularly attuned to the problems of undocumented residents
because his church runs the 3-year-old Harbor Gateway Center, one of only two
social service agencies the United Way found serving the strip.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Center's Problems
</P>
<P>
The center -- which offers a variety of nutritional, health and educational
programs to about 1,500 people -- lacks money and staff. The executive director
left more than a year ago when the money to pay her ran out. Haddon, who took
the pastor's job in July, has been doing her job ever since.
</P>
<P>
United Way officials say they would like to strengthen the center and also
persuade social service agencies in neighboring communities to expand
operations here. Their study showed that the area lacks adequate shelters for
battered women, delinquency prevention programs, drug- and alcohol-abuse
programs and crisis intervention centers.
</P>
<P>
If there is one common thread in the complaints from Gateway residents, it is
the increasing gang activity and the lack of police protection. Many said that
they go for days without seeing a patrol car and that officers covering the
area are often sent on calls elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police officials said they have been trying to improve service,
especially during the past year when citizens groups and Flores have pressed
for additional patrols. But they also acknowledged that cars are called out of
the area more often than they would like. Capt. Sandy Wasson of the Los Angeles
Police Department's Southeast Division, which covers the part of the strip
north of the San Diego Freeway, took issue with residents who say Harbor
Gateway gets less than its fair share of coverage. He said a recent deployment
study showed that while the area has fewer patrol cars -- just one basic car in
the north and one in the south -- it also has less crime.
</P>
<P>
Wasson said he views Harbor Gateway as "a neighborhood in transition that's got
great potential." He has encouraged the formation of neighborhood watch groups.
</P>
<P>
Flores, for one, said she senses a growing participation in such groups and "a
renewed interest in community improvement."
</P>
<P>
She maintained that the city has improved services in recent years, especially
police coverage. She also noted that a Harbor Gateway paramedic unit was
established in June and that this year, the city Library Department finally
included a proposal for a Harbor Gateway branch in its long-term plan.
</P>
<P>
The councilwoman said she would like the Gateway to have its own post office
and ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important," she said, "to have an actual tag and title on who you
are and where you are."
</P>
<P>
But she said she knows persuading the federal government will be difficult.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Flores said, she is thankful for whatever recognition the new
name has brought the area.
</P>
<P>
"At least," she said, "I know that when I mention Harbor Gateway in City
Council now, my colleagues know what I'm talking about."

LAWMEN STRIVE TO GET DRUNK DRIVERS OFF ROADS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
New Year's Eve party-goers who drink and drive faced a greater chance of
beginning 1989 in jail as law enforcement officers fanned out in unusually
heavy numbers Saturday to rid Southern California roadways of drunk drivers.
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol, which reported one freeway traffic death blamed
on a drunk driver late Friday, canceled days off for many officers so they
could staff an "Operation Impaired Driver" task force in the downtown area New
Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
The 42-officer unit, double the usual deployment against drunk drivers,
concentrated on the heavily traveled freeways -- the Santa Monica, Harbor,
Pasadena, Golden State and Hollywood -- that converge in downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
"They'll be out there just to look for drunken drivers, to stop them and arrest
them," CHP Officer Diane Lowery said. "It means that there will also be more
officers to assist any motorists needing help."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roadblock in Burbank
</P>
<P>
The CHP scheduled no New Year's Eve sobriety checkpoints, but at least one
local law enforcement agency, the Burbank Police Department, planned a
roadblock to snare drunk drivers beginning about one hour before dark at an
undisclosed location, Police Lt. Don Brown said.
</P>
<P>
CHP officers stopped 800 drivers at a sobriety checkpoint Friday night in
Baldwin Park, arresting five on suspicion of driving under the influence.
</P>
<P>
Police in Los Angeles set up a van that houses their Immediate Booking and
Release System behind Parker Center police headquarters, where it was to be in
operation from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m. New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
Traffic officers throughout the city planned "maximum deployment," utilizing
all available officers and assigning them specially to look for motorists under
the influence of alcohol or drugs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agencies Beef Up Patrols
</P>
<P>
Several law agencies in Orange County also planned beefed-up patrols. In Costa
Mesa, seven two-officer teams will look for drunk drivers, then put them behind
bars with the help of specially assigned jail personnel, Police Sgt. Tom Winter
said.
</P>
<P>
The CHP reported one alcohol-related traffic death about 11 p.m. Friday, six
hours into the agency's holiday fatality reporting period that ends midnight
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rene Rodriquez, 21, was booked on suspicion of felony drunk driving and
vehicular manslaughter after the fiery crash on the Harbor Freeway near El
Segundo Boulevard in South-Central Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Rodriquez drove his Datsun 280Z onto the freeway at about
100 m.p.h. When he swerved to avoid other traffic, the car struck the center
divider and flipped on its side, skidding along the cement divider for 250
yards as it burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Passenger Dies
</P>
<P>
A passenger, Raul Trevino, 28, of Lawndale, was trapped inside the car and
killed. Rodriquez escaped with minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
The CHP recorded four traffic deaths during the New Year's holiday period last
year in Los Angeles County. Statewide, 43 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
CHP officers arrested 467 people for suspected drunk driving in Los Angeles
County last year and made 1,874 arrests statewide.

2 MEN SLAIN AS 1988 SHOOTINGS SET A RECORD
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two young men were killed and four people wounded as drive-by gunmen and street
gangs marked the beginning of the long holiday weekend with a series of
shootings, ending 1988 with record mayhem.
</P>
<P>
The weekend's first fatal shooting occurred at 9 p.m. Friday in South Los
Angeles, where Raymond Smith, 21, was shot and killed, apparently by occupants
of a passing car, as he stood in the 200 block of West 84th Street, Lt. Bob
Hansohn said. Nearby, 20 minutes later, Adam Lopez, 16, was shot to death from
a passing car as he walked out of a liquor store at 54th and Hoover streets.
</P>
<P>
The two shootings were not believed to be related. Hansohn, of the 77th Street
Division, said no suspects had been taken into custody but the shootings "would
probably turn out to be" gang-related.
</P>
<P>
Three other shootings, all in an area west of downtown, were apparently
retaliatory attacks involving two rival gangs, Sgt. Ray Heslop of the Rampart
Division said Saturday. Those shootings left four people wounded, two of them
critically.
</P>
<P>
Heslop said Edward Moran, 21, of Tujunga, was driving past a group of men
gathered on a front porch on Witmer Street between 3rd and 6th streets at 11:30
p.m. Friday, when they yelled out gang slogans and fired three shots, Heslop
said. Moran was hit once in the leg.
</P>
<P>
Nearby, Ramon Gomez, 24, was standing at the corner of Temple Street and
Edgeware Road at 1 a.m. Saturday when two men drove past in a car and fired
three shots from a small caliber revolver, Heslop said. He was wounded in the
knee.
</P>
<P>
Heslop said the shooting "was apparently" by the same gang members who had
fired at Moran from the sidewalk and who had gotten into a car to continue the
gunplay.
</P>
<P>
A third shooting, possibly related to the first two, occurred at 2:30 a.m. near
Crown Hill Street and Loma Drive when several shots were fired from an unknown
source into a group of young men and women, critically wounding a man in the
arm and back, and a woman in the chest and back, Heslop said.
</P>
<P>
Both victims were taken to the County-USC Medical Center. Their names were not
released.
</P>
<P>
The killings in the 77th Street Division were not included in either the
Sheriff's or Police Department's preliminary statistics, which indicated 1988
would end with record totals of gang violence.
</P>
<P>
The Police Department reported 207 gang killings in the first 10 months of the
year, a 24.7% jump over the 166 in the same period of 1987.
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department, which patrols unincorporated areas of Los Angeles
County and contracts its services to smaller cities, reported 94 gang killings
in 1988, an 18.1% increase over 1987.
</P>
<P>
Although police statistics were available only through October, the sheriff's
report, issued Friday, backed up statements by Sheriff Sherman Block that gang
violence was on a dramatic rise.

THE YEAR THE AMERICAN MOVIE CAME BACK;
</P>
<P>
'ACCIDENTAL TOURIST' TOPS THE TIMES' CRITIC'S 10 BEST OF 1988
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are years when a look back over the year's most significant films for
that arbitrary ten comes with what one writer once called that nasty ratcheting
sound made by scraping the bottom of the barrel. Then there are years when each
move to pare down to only 10 brings hours of remorse and deliberation.
</P>
<P>
And oddly enough, this was one of those killer years. As it warmed up, 1988 may
not have seemed fated to be an extra superbly choicest year, if you could grade
movies the way they grade tea. But it gained momentum after a slow first half
until finally the year could be chalked up as fat, full and innovative.
</P>
<P>
You cannot fault innovation, not in the same calendar year that marked "Who
Framed Roger Rabbit" and "Little Dorrit," but full is certainly a big part of
that equation. Between new screens cropping up like mushrooms after a rain and
the insatiable maw of video, which insists that movies at least curtsy on a big
screen before being gulped down into the small one, we are seeing roughly 60
more films now than we did in 1982.
</P>
<P>
When you are staring, dumbfounded, at the marshamallowed dimensions of a film
like "Zelly and Me" it can seem a particularly high psychic price to pay,
simply to fill more theater screens. Particularly when some of the theaters are
roughly the size of an airline washroom, and flood with light whenever
late-comers shuffle into to one of their 45 seats.
</P>
<P>
Then a film like "The Chocolate War" gets its crack at one of those screens,
giving audiences a chance to discover the strengths of its astonishingly
assured young debuting director, Keith Gordon, and it all seems worth it again.
</P>
<P>
1988 may be remembered as the point at which the quintessentially American
movie came back into its own, giving us the outright delights of "Punchline,"
"Bull Durham," "Big," "8 Men Out," "Roger Rabbit," "Dominick and Eugene,"
"Tucker" or " Working Girl."
</P>
<P>
It was also the year for films adapted from exceptionally knotty books, and
succeed or fail, the determination involved in "The Unbearable Lightness of
Being," "The Accidental Tourist," "Little Dorrit," "The Milagro Beanfield War,"
"Pelle the Conqueror" and "The Last Temptation of Christ" had to be admired.
</P>
<P>
Art, music and even food had their day on the screen with "The Moderns,"
"Vincent," "Bird" "Long Live the Lady" and "Babette's Feast." By and large,
films with urgent social or political issues still came with passports or not
at all: "A World Apart," "Hotel Terminus: the Life and Times of Klaus Barbie,"
"A Cry in the Dark," "Salaam Bombay!" In some cases it was a foreign-born
director who took on American social issues, the case of "Betrayed" and
"Mississippi Burning."
</P>
<P>
The 10 films that impressed me most this year are below, ranked in order, with
special notice that "Punchline" very nearly threw the whole matter into a tie.
So, the runner up-list is a hair's breath one this year.
</P>
<P>
1. "It's not just how much you love someone," William Hurt as a grieving father
muses in "The Accidental Tourist," "it's who you are when you're with them."
Director-co-writer Lawrence Kasdan has made watching this man come alive,
perhaps for the first time, into a small-scale epiphany. What's startling is
how this story, which takes place during Hurt's second year of mourning, can be
as funny as it is. However, like Anne Tyler's singular book, the humor comes
from character and the family Hurt springs from is memorable enough to have
escaped from Dickens. Among the excellent ensemble, all of whom seem to have a
decidedly droll bent and a knack for underplaying, you can find the
irresistible Geena Davis. She plays a dog obedience trainer to whom Hurt's
Welsh corgi, Edward, takes an enormous shine. It's entirely understandable.
</P>
<P>
2. "Little Dorrit's" virtues are not simply its off-handed display of the cream
of British actors: Derek Jacobi, Alec Guinness, Miriam Margolyes, Roshan Seth,
Joan Greenwood, Eleanor Bron, Cyril Cusack, but the toughness and
accomplishment with which director Christine Edzard's adaptation makes Dickens
as pertinent as this week's stock-fixing headlines.
</P>
<P>
The qualities which made George Bernard Shaw call the novel "more seditious
than "Das Kapital" are here in abundance and Edzard asks that we see the story
in two films, six hours in all; however her method is not epic but intimate. By
the time we have come to Dorrit's triumphant conclusion, the faces, and voices
of London at that time, the working poor as well as the drawling rich, have
been stamped upon us forever.
</P>
<P>
3. "A Cry in the Dark" is an angry film, an outraged one really, as director
Fred Schepisi lays out the almost unbelieveable path of Australian
jurisprudence and/or media hijinks by which a bereft mother became, in the eyes
of the public, the ritual killer of her own infant daughter.
</P>
<P>
Its power comes from Schepisi's blend of passion and detachment and from the
best performance Meryl Streep has given so far. (Do we seem to write this each
year? If so, it's true -- this is a talent you can watch deepen and become
further refined with each role.) Streep has a perfectly matched thoroughbred
opposite her in Sam Neill; he makes this Seventh Day Adventist pastor's fall
from smugness and self-assurance a wracking business.
</P>
<P>
4. "Salaam, Bombay!" throws us into the life of Bombay's street kids with an
ebullience and an energy that's matched exactly by the film's tough-mindedness.
Director Mira Nair asks for no pity for her urchins and she doesn't romanticize
them either, but there is no way you cannot be haunted by them. "Salaam
Bombay!" is not Nair's first film about exploitation as a way of life in
India's cities, but it is her first non-documentary and she brings to her work
a wonderful eye and a truly cinematic flair for story telling. As you leave
10-year old Krishna, you may be reminded of "The 400 Blows," sacrilegious as
that may sound. But "Salaam Bombay!" didn't win Nair the Camera D'Or at Cannes
in 1988, for best new director, for nothing.
</P>
<P>
5. In a year of largely literal films, the poetry of Wim Wenders' "Wings of
Desire" soars, on the wings of his two Berliner angels, with Peter Handke's
screenplay and with the camera of Henri Alekan, who might be considered
something of an expert on black and white fairy tales, since it was he who also
photographed "Beauty and the Beast." Peter Falk gives the film a wry, gutsy
center, but its essence is its passionate declaration of the need for trust,
love and commitment; a cheerfully anachronistic, contagiously optimistic tack.
6. In a way, Austrian director Percy Adlon was working on the same wavelength
in "Bagdad Cafe" that Wenders was in "Wings of Desire," although Adlon was
playing a little more with the elements of personal discovery. Those qualities
make "Bagdad Cafe" a slow-burning fuse, whose charm grows on you like its great
and haunting song, "I'm Calling You."
</P>
<P>
Its story of two heartily unalike women, the American CCH Pounder, the Bavarian
Marianne Sagebrecht, who meet and join forces against a largely disinterested
world in the California desert, depends largely on the charm of ex-cabaret
artist Sagebrecht and long-time theater actress Pounder. Both of them are
exceptional, but Sagebrecht carries a special something extra, as anyone who
saw her in "Sugarbaby" will remember.
</P>
<P>
7. Ostensibly about a "failed" car manufacturer, "Tucker," is Francis Ford
Coppola's tribute to America's loners, its dreamers, whether they make
ballpoint pens, or vast unflyable airplanes like the film's enigma, Howard
Hughes. (Or, by the smallest stretch, if they make roundly disliked movies.)
Loose-limbed and innovative, fueled by a full-throttle performance by Jeff
Bridges as Tucker, it's a film that could have used more of the darker tones of
Tucker's life -- heaven knows there were enough of them. But scenes like the
launching of "The car of tomorrow, today" or the mysterioso meeting between
Tucker and Dean Stockwell's Howard Hughes do a lot toward shutting down minor
complaints.
</P>
<P>
8. The beauty and control David Cronenberg uses to tell his melancholy, macabre
tale of symbiotic twin doctors in "Dead Ringers" shows the director at a new
high of maturity, and Jeremy Irons' dual portrayal as one bordering on the
eerie. Dealing, again, with the body, its mysteries and its final frightening
independence from what we would have it do, "Dead Ringers"' twins are loosely
based on a real Manhattan pair, but they are more plainly metaphors for any
relationship that begins in love and ends in pathology. To think of a film this
assured, this unified and this dizzyingly potent, you have to go back to "Blue
Velvet."
</P>
<P>
9. "Red Sorghum" makes you suspect that its director, 37-year old Zhang Yimou,
was cinema-doomed from the cradle: His saga, which ends during the Japanese
invasion of China, is part folk-tale, part love story and completely thrilling
to behold. To credit this as Zhang's directorial debut is not to tell the whole
story: before this he has also been a masterly cinematographer ("Yellow Earth,"
"The Big Parade) and an actor whose performance in "The Old Well" won him first
prize at Tokyo's Film Festival. It's especially interesting to see a film from
modern China with the scale and sensibilities about nature of the Kurosawa of
"Dersu Uzala."
</P>
<P>
10. After you see "A World Apart" you realize that the great film about South
Africa is still waiting to be made. However, this personal one, the homage by a
daughter to her martyred mother -- the first white woman jailed under South
Africa's 90-day detention law -- as empathetically directed by Chris Menges, is
a firm step in that direction. Three memorably fine performances came out of
this: Barbara Hershey and young Jodhi May as mother and daughter; Linda Mvusi
as their housekeeper. If somehow the facts of existence in South Africa had
escaped you, " A World Apart" might be the perfect place to start.
</P>
<P>
Those hotly close runners-up are "Punchline," "The Moderns," "Babette's Feast,"
"8 Men Out," "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown," "Last Temptation of
Christ," "Hotel Terminus: the Life and times of Klaus Barbie," "Track 29,"
"Vincent" and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit."

MORE FILM FAVORITES OF 1988
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Unbearable Lightness of Being" -- It was a year of superb novel
adaptations, "Little Dorrit" included. But Milan Kundera's tale of love,
politics, sex and repression in '60s-'70s Czechoslovakia was fashioned here, by
director Philip Kaufman, into a genuine watershed American film: A startling
departure -- in form, style, psychological and social content -- from almost
all of the '80s' mainline U.S. studio product.
</P>
<P>
"The Last Temptation of Christ" -- Did most of the people who kicked up the
fuss really see Martin Scorsese's movie -- or understand what they saw? From
Kazantzakis' novel, a firmly Christian work of high idealism, beautifully
mounted, not intentionally lewd or blasphemous; only Paul Schrader's
street-tough dialogue keeps it from being a masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
"Melo" -- Henri Bernstein's tense play about a tragic quadrangle in a world of
classical musicians: The very title suggests "melodrama," and director Alain
Resnais has defiantly refused to "open it up." Never moving from an obvious
proscenium set, it somehow seems to distill the soul of theater, the beating
heart of 1929 Paris.
</P>
<P>
"Wings of Desire" -- Writer Peter Handke, master cinematographer Henri Alekan
and director Wim Wenders -- cinematic poet of alienated loners on the road --
create an eerie, rapt modern fairy tale in which Berlin angels watch over the
monochrome world of the lost and lonely and yearn for the bright colored day of
passion, circuses and love.
</P>
<P>
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit" -- A monstrous high-voltage audience-hit from
director Robert Zemeckis, that, like John McTiernan's "Die Hard," was also a
technical marvel. I'd like the last trip to Toonvile to be more surrealistic,
crazier; otherwise, it doesn't miss a trick.
</P>
<P>
"A Taxing Woman" -- Through the Byzantine financial catacombs of modern Japan,
a piquant tax investigator pursues a swaggering cheat. Director Juzo Itami
("Tampopo,") gives us a wry, piercing, hawk-eyed view of his country's new
commercialism, its loss of tradition and the samurai heart that seems to beat
beneath it's plexiglass shield.
</P>
<P>
"The Moderns" -- Supposedly it takes place in the expatriate's Paris of 1926,
but actually this movie -- drifting along on its cloud of soft jazz,
overlapping banter and wine-rich colors -- is set in no real landscape at all.
A sweet, devious meditation on art, love, life and artifice; the most special
and delightful of Alan Rudolph's films.
</P>
<P>
"Tucker" -- Cars and conspiracies, invention and intimidation, flash and free
enterprise; Francis Coppola strongly reclaims his turf. A full-throated shout
of American optimism, tinged with fatalism and a canny awareness of the traps
awaiting any dreamer.
</P>
<P>
"Bird" -- A jazz lover's dream: A song in darkness, joy wrung out of grief. No
director this year showed more devotion to his/her subject matter than Clint
Eastwood in this soulful elegy to Charlie Parker and the world of '40s-'50s
be-bop.
</P>
<P>
"Long Live the Lady!" -- A neglected little gem, by Ermanno Olmi, that I like
as much as the better-known culinary fable "Babette's Feast" (not to mention
its wonderful Danish compatriot, "Pelle the Conqueror"). It's a community
comedy about lower-class waiters at a lavish Italian mountaintop business
banquet; a feast that becomes, like Babette's, a metaphor for all the traps of
society, all the divisions of life.

STAGE '88;
</P>
<P>
1988: IT WAS A BATTLE;
</P>
<P>
BUT LATC -- AND OTHERS -- CAME THROUGH WITH STRONG SHOWS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A surprising amount of good work got done in Los Angeles theater in 1988,
considering that it was a war year.
</P>
<P>
For months, Actors' Equity and the smaller theaters fought out the question of
how to compensate Waiver actors. This at least established the principle that
Waiver actors deserved compensation. But it also used up a lot of energy. By
year's end, you had to hope that the Waiver wars were winding down: Everybody
was sick of them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the smaller theaters got on with it. A fine young writer named Jamie
Baker had a double debut. His "Don't Go Back to Rockville" was first seen at
the Pacific Theatre Ensemble, then at the Victory Theatre. Set in 1944, it
concerned a surly young Kentucky Derby jockey named Ed (Andrew Philpot). His
unaffectionate progeny turned up a few months later at the Tamarind Theater in
Baker's "South Central Rain."
</P>
<P>
Ed and his nasty-nice spawn didn't have a lot to recommend them as human
beings, but they had a sneaky vitality as stage characters. They suggested
Lanford Wilson's Talley clan, except that they didn't come off as "characters,"
but as people with real needs -- even if selfish ones. Volume Three of this
family saga is awaited with interest.
</P>
<P>
Rafael Lima also hit the mark with "El Salvador" at the Gnu Theatre. The scene
here was a hotel room from which a group of journalists were trying to cover
the war in El Salvador without getting their heads shot off, and the message
was that this kind of life can get to be addictive. An oddly effective
combination of "The Front Page" and "Apocalypse Now," tautly directed by the
Gnu's Jeff Seymour.
</P>
<P>
It was an election year, and the Bush-Dukakis debates provided playacting of a
dim sort. But there weren't many overtly political plays. Jeff Goldsmith's
"McCarthy" at the Odyssey came closest, a somewhat overwritten script, but with
two lean and mean performances: Victor Brandt as Tail Gunner Joe and Ralph
Seymour as Roy Cohn.
</P>
<P>
AIDS remained a scourge. "Jerker" -- the notorious script by Robert Chesley
that the FCC had found pornographic when it was performed on KPFK -- got a live
production at the Fifth Estate Theatre. It ended with a tired voice saying,
over a Judy Garland record, that he couldn't come to the phone right now but
please leave a message. No more needed to be said.
</P>
<P>
In larger theaters, the best work, and certainly the most work, was done by the
Los Angeles Theatre Center. Not everything that LATC attempted came off, but
each of its shows had a reason for being and left a sense that somebody at the
theater was in its corner.
</P>
<P>
LATC introduced us to two playwrights with imagination and control, Jose Rivera
and Marlane Meyer. Rivera was born in Puetro Rico, and his "The Promise" was a
wild juxtaposition of family drama and tall tale, set in a world as real as a
rusty muffler, yet a world where demons came and went. Marlane Meyer gave us
two plays, "Etta Jenks" and "Kingfish." The first brought back to life the
cliche of the girl who goes to the dogs when she tries to break into the
movies. Meyer's script worked because it dealt with the grungy Hollywood that
actually exists, as opposed to the Oz of popular imagination; and because Meyer
didn't waste any time sentimentalizing over Etta. (Actress Deirdre O'Connell
didn't sentimentalize her, either.)
</P>
<P>
"Kingfish" concerned a non-existent dog who nonetheless existed, since it was
to the interest of certain parties that he do so. This could have been a
terribly precious play. Perhaps the conceptual framework imposed on it by
director David Schweizer was a bit precious. But, again, Meyer knew her people.
She knew, for instance, that a lonely bachelor (Buck Henry) might covet a son
(Merritt Butrick) so badly that he would pay to have one. This script didn't go
any farther out than human behavior does. We're just not used to seeing it go
this far in the theater.
</P>
<P>
LATC also took on the Russians. Stein Winge's nightmarish production of "The
Inspector General" got all tangled up in its bedclothes, but Ron Campbell
proved wonderfully idiotic in the lead. Charles Marowitz's staging of "The Sea
Gull" was dead-on: a production that called Chekhov's characters to account,
rather than issuing them a blanket pardon because they were all so sensitive.
</P>
<P>
Bill Bushnell's staging of Alexander Galin's "Stars in the Morning Sky" didn't
redeem a pedestrian script about some played-out whores in "protective custody"
during the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Nevertheless, as with "Sarcophagus" in '87,
the play was an interesting theater event -- further proof that Soviet
playwrights no longer have to pretend that they live in Utopia.
</P>
<P>
This was the pattern at LATC last year: Even when the play fell short, the
viewer could grab onto something. Another example: Chloe Webb's exuberant
performance as the schizophrenic daughter in "The Model Apartment." LATC is on
a roll these days: You can feel the energy in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
The only time you felt that energy in the Mark Taper Forum lobby in '88 was
after "The Colored Museum." Younger viewers, black and white, had been
exhilarated by the anger in George C. Wolfe's script, while older people
suspected that Wolfe was reviving the hurtful black stereotypes of the past,
under the guise of satirizing them.
</P>
<P>
Few other Taper plays proved so stimulating: Certainly not its yuppified
production of George Walker's "Nothing Sacred." It was good to see Joe Chaikin
back at Taper, Too. Director Robert Woodruff kept Sam Shepard's loose-jointed
"A Lie of the Mind" all in one piece. Ron Taylor gave a tremendous supporting
performance in
</P>
<P>
"Lost Highway." But it was a season that said "Me, too" rather than, as in the
old days at the Taper, "Look at this!" Or are we romanticizing the old days?
</P>
<P>
"Fences" was the Doolittle's big hit, with James Earl Jones even more resonant
than he had been on Broadway, and Lynne Thigpen taking no garbage as his wife.
Another August Wilson play, "Joe Turner's Come and Gone," played the Old Globe
Theatre prior to Broadway, with Delroy Lindo as a self-flaying fugitive.
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena Playhouse, once given up for dead, had a fine year. Amanda McBroom
starred in the splendid "Lies and Legends," based on Harry Chapin's songs. The
show later transferred to Beverly Hills. We can't understand why Robert
Harling's beauty-parlor comedy "Steel Magnolias" didn't make a similar
transfer. Barbara Rush and the rest of the cast loved doing it, the audience
loved watching it, and even a critic had to acknowledge that behind the sitcom
rhythms, there was a genuine admiration here for the way women can get it
together.
</P>
<P>
As opposed to men. Jules Feiffer's "Carnal Knowledge" at the Playhouse had
Gregory Harrison and David Marshall Grant as two guys who treat women like The
Enemy, and end up sandbagging themselves. This was also the predicament of Sean
Penn, Danny Aiello and the other scuzzy Hollywood guys in "Hurlyburly," staged
by playwright David Rabe at the Westwood Playhouse.
</P>
<P>
Disgracefully, the "Hurlyburly" company canceled a performance just before
curtain-time, the excuse being that their friend Gary Busey had just had a
motorcycle accident. The professional reaction, in this circumstance, is to
dedicate the performance to your friend and go on. Nonetheless, Penn and his
colleagues -- including Mare Winningham as the toughest of their lady friends
-- gave "Hurlyburly" one hell of a ride.
</P>
<P>
The funniest classical revival of the year was South Coast Repertory's "School
for Scandal," which director Paul Marcus set in a strange land where
18th-Century types read the National Enquirer. SCR also brought us an urgent
revival of "The Crucible," directed by Martin Benson -- one of those shows
where the audience gasps even when it knows what's coming next. In San Diego,
the show of the year was the San Diego Repertory Theatre's "Red Noses," Peter
Barnes' black comedy about the uses of comedy in a bad time. Co-produced with
the Dell'Arte Players of Blue Lake, Calif., the production combined expert
clowning and scathing satire. Only one show gave us more pure pleasure during
1988 -- the Moscow Circus.

POP EYE: CLINKERS AMONG THE POP NOTES OF '88
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everybody hooted last January when Texas record producer (and legendary
self-promoter) Major Bill Smith concocted an Elvis Presley birthday tribute,
"Hey! Big E. Happy 53!," claiming The King had faked his death so he could live
in anonymity.
</P>
<P>
But Major Bill had the last laugh. In a year when Brian Wilson, Patti Smith and
Jimmy Page's comebacks flopped, Elvis had the biggest revival of all, making
tabloid headlines, starring in Priscilla's best-seller and being celebrated in
a musical about his life.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year, you got the feeling Elvis was on tour again -- popping
up at Burger Kings in Kalamazoo, car washes in Georgia and the parking lot of a
Las Vegas hotel. In August, WCVG in Cincinnati switched to an all-Elvis format.
In September, Cheap Trick's "Don't Be Cruel" became the first Elvis re-make to
go Top 10. In November, Priscilla and Lisa Marie did an Olds ad. In December,
an L.A. Elvis impersonator announced plans to turn his San Fernando Valley home
into a mock Graceland.
</P>
<P>
Even without Elvis, 1988 was a banner year for pop follies. So let's celebrate
the music world's clown princes in our yearly round-up of dubious achievements,
inglorious moments and show-biz scams.
</P>
<P>
PRESENTER OF THE YEAR: Beach Boy Mike Love, who livened up the 1988 Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame Awards by noisily blasting Mick Jagger: "We did 180
performances last year. . . . I'd like to see Mick Jagger get on stage and do
'I Get Around' rather than 'Jumpin' Jack Flash.' Mick's always been chicken to
get on stage with the Beach Boys."
</P>
<P>
JAIL SENTENCE: To the Yugoslav folk singer who was sentenced to 60 days in jail
and fined $80 for refusing to sing "Comrade Tito, We Pledge to You That We Will
Not Swerve From Your Path," an official state song glorifying Marshal Tito,
founder of the country's Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
PRINCE FAN: Richard Nixon, who titled his latest political tract "1999."
</P>
<P>
NATIONAL ANTHEM PERFORMANCE: Saxophonist Kenny G, whose anthem rendition at the
sixth game of the National League playoffs here was blasted as "unbelievably
terrible" by Dodger second baseman Steve Sax. "I can't believe it. It was the
worst I ever heard. I could have played it better than he did," said Sax, who
was so upset that he shook his fist at G while walking back to the dugout.
Dodger right fielder Mike Marshall added: "It was a disgrace to America."
</P>
<P>
QUOTE, PART 1: Debbie Gibson: "On Halloween, I had a party where we had a
seance. We tried to contact Liberace and Sid Vicious."
</P>
<P>
DRUG BUST: Reporting that soul legend James Brown was charged for possession of
the hallucinogenic drug PCP after a car chase through two states this fall,
Rolling Stone quoted a Georgia Highway patrolman who said that when arrested,
Brown "started singing 'Georgia' and was doing his 'Good Foot' dance when we
gave him the sobriety test."
</P>
<P>
GRAMMY ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: Best Female Country Vocal Performance winner K.T.
Oslin, who told the press: "I'm so excited that I feel like I'm going to throw
up any minute now."
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC ADDRESS ANNOUNCER: Paul Strelzin, announcer for the Texas League's El
Paso Diablos, was ejected from a game against the Jackson Mets after
infuriating umpires by repeatedly playing the verse "I've been cheated, been
mistreated" from Linda Ronstadt's "When Will I Be Loved" after a series of
close calls at first base.
</P>
<P>
BACKSTAGE STIFF: When ex-Ollie North secretary Fawn Hall asked to meet Bruce
Springsteen backstage at his Washington concert, she received a note saying: "I
didn't think much of Ollie North, so why should I want to meet his secretary?"
</P>
<P>
QUOTE, PART 2: Terence Trent D'Arby: "I've had three lives: The first time I
was an Ethiopian pirate around 600 BC. Then I was an 18th-Century painter. The
last time I was a very talented but unsuccessful country and Western singer."
</P>
<P>
RAMONES FAN: Celebrated Manhattan preppie-killer Robert Chambers. He donned a
shoulder-length wig and imitated Ramones leader Joey Ramone singing "Rockaway
Beach" on a videotape that an ex-girlfriend sold to a local New York TV
station, which aired the clip earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
SUBPOENA: When contestants in a lawsuit involving former MCA artist Donnie Iris
couldn't persuade MCA Records chairman Irving Azoff to testify in a lawsuit
hearing, they served the industry mogul with a subpoena at the Forum during
half time of a Lakers-Spurs playoff game.
</P>
<P>
DEEJAY: After the Baltimore Orioles lost 10 straight games, Baltimore morning
deejay Bob Rivers swore he would stay locked in his WIYY-FM studio until the
team won a game. He ended up stuck on the air for 258 straight hours until the
team ended its record 21-game losing streak last April.
</P>
<P>
WORST BAND NAME: Johnny Hates Jazz.
</P>
<P>
MOLL: Dolly Parton, who totes a gun -- legally -- and said she pulled it out of
her purse when accosted by a man when she was walking in New York this summer.
"I pointed it at him and told him if he didn't take a hike, I'd turn him into a
soprano."
</P>
<P>
LED ZEPPELIN FAN: Spago impresario Wolfgang Puck, who apparently forgot that
Jimmy Page was the band's guitar hero. When ex-Zeppelin singer Robert Plant was
in town for a summer concert appearance, Puck presented him with a
guitar-shaped pizza.

QUOTE, PART 3: Washington Wife crusader Tipper Gore: "I love rock 'n' roll. I
was one of the earliest Springsteen fans. I played drums in high school. You're
talking to someone who really understands rock music."
</P>
<P>
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: During last year's February sweeps, KABC-TV ballyhooed a
chat with ex-Beatle George Harrison as an "exclusive" interview -- even though
Harrison complained throughout the story about "all these interviews" he had
been doing.
</P>
<P>
MANAGER: Doc McGhee, whose management firm handles such pop superstars as Bon
Jovi and Motley Crue, pleaded guilty last January to importing 40,000 pounds of
marijuana, worth $9 million, into the United States. The indictment came weeks
after McGhee and partner Doug Thaler were named personal managers of the year
in Pollstar magazine's Readers Poll Awards.
</P>
<P>
OVERSTATEMENT: When the American Cinematheque screened the rarely seen Sex
Pistols documentary, "The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle" in January, festival
organizers ballyhooed the showing as "the last U.S. screening ever." This came
as a surprise to Julien Temple, the film's director, who quipped: "What are
they going to do -- burn it?"
</P>
<P>
FRAGRANCE: John Lennon's first wife, Cynthia, took advantage of the hoopla
surrounding her late husband by launching a new fragrance, Woman perfume. The
fragrance was named after the song "Woman," from Lennon's "Double Fantasy"
album, even though the ballad was written for Yoko Ono, the woman Lennon left
Cynthia to marry.
</P>
<P>
REUNION: When the Stray Cats held a press conference in August to herald the
band getting back together after a four-year layoff, the group somehow
neglected to mention that they had recorded a reunion album two years ago --
which stiffed.

MAGAZINE ISSUE: Spin magazine's November issue, which contained a free condom
in each copy as a symbol of the editors' support for safe sex practices.

L.A. BEAT: BEST OF '88 WON'T SHATTER ANY TRENDS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If your great-aunt's bridge club donned leather cycle duds and power-chorded
its way through songs about life in the gutter, it'd probably stand a good
chance of getting a record deal.
</P>
<P>
At least that's the way it seems, considering the hard-rock feeding frenzy on
the part of record companies in the wake of Guns N' Roses' multi-platinum
breakthrough. And with Geffen having snapped up such promising bands as Little
Caesar and Junkyard, there's no reason to think that frenzy won't continue well
into 1989.
</P>
<P>
Not that the continually healthy street-metal crowd had much competition this
year:
</P>
<P>
The best thing you could say about the rest of the L.A. rock scene in 1988 was
that nothing really coalesced into any kind of movement that would be easy for
trendoids and sycophants to glom onto, meaning that many worthy acts around
town were free to develop on their own and not worry about fitting into a
"scene."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the worst thing about the L.A. rock scene in 1988 was that
nothing new really coalesced into any kind of movement that would produce an
irresistible buzz, meaning that many worthy acts around town didn't get the
attention they deserved.
</P>
<P>
After all, what does it say about the vitality of the local club circuit when
one of the brightest pop hopes to emerge from L.A. in 1988 -- Melissa Etheridge
-- determined that playing the clubs was a waste of time and elected to build
her career through playing beach community taverns?
</P>
<P>
And who would have thought that the local independent act to get the most media
attention would be Ailee Willis "discoverees," the Del Rubio Triplets, three
middle-aged sisters who apply their harmonies to the likes of "Walk Like an
Egyptian" and Willis' "Neutron Dance," and make most of their concert
appearances at nursing and retirement homes?
</P>
<P>
There are, though, two promising trends that began to emerge in '88: Nu Folk
(the name's gotta go) and the latest edition of L.A. psychedelia.
</P>
<P>
Such clubs as Bogart's, Club Lingerie and the Music Machine suddenly swung open
their doors to acoustic troubadours, while new clubs like the Breakaway and the
Gaslight were created specifically for that low-key approach. (The revived Ash
Grove couldn't make it, though.)
</P>
<P>
Nu names to watch: meaning-seeker Mark Davis and witty social observer Milo
Binder seem the most likely to make a mark, while bands Different World and the
Beef Sisters could develop into contenders as well.
</P>
<P>
Among the murky mind-expansion brigade, Jane's Addiction is certainly the most
prominent, while fellow late-night denizen Caterwaul also seems a good
candidate for big things, based on the preview EP I.R.S. has just issued. An
album from the Betsy Martin-fronted quartet is due early this year. The stable
of psyche-rock purveyors at Nate Starkman &amp; Son records also seems quite
promising, with Shiva Burlesque, the best of the bunch, reportedly getting some
major label attention these days.
</P>
<P>
The best live club act this year was Mary's Danish, which combines the droll
wit and delivery of singers Julie Ritter and Gretchen Seager with a wild, loose
funk-rock sound. American Martyrs and the Bel-Fires have also both developed
strong live presences that seem ripe for big-label vinyl.
</P>
<P>
The Wild Cards, who released a debut LP "Cool Not Cold," also could (finally)
be the band to follow fellow Latinos Los Lobos to national attention. And the
country world offers potential matinee idol Jim Lauderdale (a debut album
coming soon from Epic), country-rock songstresses Lucinda Williams (a new album
that more than lives up to her good name around local clubs) and Kimm Rogers.

SOUND &amp; VISION: A LONG SEARCH FOR THE BEST PERFECT VIDEO
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sound &amp; Vision searched the tube over, channel after channel, in search of
quality rock video clips that would reflect consenting adults enjoying normal,
healthy relationships. We found exactly . . . one. To round out most of the
other nine slots in our 1988 Video Top 10, we had to settle for well-executed
renditions of the same old song and dance.
</P>
<P>
The year's best:
</P>
<P>
1. Joni Mitchell's "My Secret Place" (Director: Anton Corbijn). Perhaps one of
the few videos ever made to convey such emotional intimacy, "Secret" dramatized
a fetching Mitchell and glowing duet partner Peter Gabriel quietly bonding over
dinner (!). Warm, subtle and recognizably human, it naturally received almost
no airplay.
</P>
<P>
2. George Harrison's "When We Was Fab" (Godley &amp; Creme). If the "Magical
Mystery Tour" film had lived up to its potential, it might have had the charm
of this effects-filled clip, a bit of winsome but hard-edged nostalgia for the
more psychedelic days of the Fab Four.
</P>
<P>
3. Michael Jackson's "Smooth Criminal" (Colin Chilvers). A silly but eminently
watchable (and rewatchable) 10-minute all-singing, all-dancing extravaganza
that's a marked return to video form for the Gloved One. The best rhythm track
off Jackson's "Bad" album is combined with fresh choreography that shows the
Fred Astaire comparisons may not be so off base after all.
</P>
<P>
4. Bruce Springsteen's "One Step Up" (Meiert Avis). Though set in a
working-class bar atmosphere far removed from Springsteen's daily life, this
tone poem on marital alienation and straying affections held more resonance for
many curious viewers -- like much of the "Tunnel of Love" album -- in the face
of subsequent events.
</P>
<P>
5. Nancy Sinatra's "These Boots Are Made for Walkin"' (Robert Sidney). A
re-release of a 22-year-old clip, "Boots" demonstrated that -- even with
then-acceptable cellulite and relatively modest mini-skirts -- Nancy and her
booted dancing partners could out-fox Lita Ford any day.
</P>
<P>
6. Roy Orbison's "Oh Pretty Woman" (Tony Mitchell). Excerpted from the
star-studded cable-TV gala filmed at the Cocoanut Grove. What's that we see?
He's walkin' back to us . . . in mementos like this video, at least, if --
sadly -- no longer in life.
</P>
<P>
7. Steve Winwood's "Roll With It" (David Finchman). What a wonderful fantasy: A
night out at a sweaty, sepia-toned, racially integrated bar in which Winwood
leads the house soul band.
</P>
<P>
8. LL Cool J's "Goin' Back to Cali" (Ric Menello). A New York rapper's-eye-view
of a return to L.A. in which all the cliches (palm trees, cruising) somehow
look fresh.
</P>
<P>
9. Weird Al Yankovic's "Fat" (Jay Levy). Combine the non-stop obesity jokes on
the sound track with the non-stop Michael Jackson parody on the screen -- one
big non sequitur if ever there was one -- and what you get is a tasteless,
pointlessly hilarious guilty pleasure.
</P>
<P>
10. Sam Brown's "Stop" (Eric Watson). A blond. A red dress. A soulful voice
tackling a slow blues ballad. Sometimes life's simplest pleasures are best.

THE BLOSSOMING OF L.A. ARTISTS IN '88.;
</P>
<P>
MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR PRICES FOR 'PRICELESS' PIECES WERE NUMBING, BUT OUT HERE
THE OUTLOOK IS DOWN-TO-EARTH

<P>
Well, it's over again. Bits of pastel serpentine weave through the carpet and a
champagne cork is wedged into the potted palm. Time to stare out at the garden
and ruminate on '88.
</P>
<P>
It might have gone down as the year when the tainted opulence of Post-Modernism
was in full flower, the spectacle of an art world where aesthetics are swamped
by jillionaire collectors flourishing power.
</P>
<P>
Winter: Armand Hammer announced he would jerk his blue-chip collection away
from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art where it had been promised repeatedly
for nearly 20 years. Hammer decided to establish his own private boutique
museum in Westwood.
</P>
<P>
Spring: Negotiations aimed at bringing Norton Simon's fabled collections under
the stewardship of UCLA guttered out.
</P>
<P>
Summer: The annual confrontation between the J. Paul Getty Museum and Thomas
Hoving's Connoisseur magazine arrived with the predictability of the gas bill.
The Getty bought a rare ancient Greek Aphrodite and Hoving said it had been
smuggled out of Italy. Something similar had happened the year before. And the
year before that.
</P>
<P>
Fall: New York auctions turned into a feeding frenzy that drove prices for
modern art to stratospheric obscenity. A Jasper Johns brought $17 million. A
Picasso at $24.75 million, then another in London for $38.5 million. Sales
totals in the hundreds of millions.
</P>
<P>
Felt like the Last Days of Pompeii, lavish hysteria.
</P>
<P>
Remember when great art was called "priceless"? There was something nice about
that. "Priceless" said it doesn't matter if a work of art sells for $50 or $50
million, the experience of it is about something else, something delicate,
numinous and poetic. Hard figures vulgarize the expression like a price tag put
on the act of love.
</P>
<P>
It could have been remembered as a year of fascinating naughty titivating
tattle out of "Life Styles of the Rich and Arrogant" but things happened in Los
Angeles that evidence significance. A generation of artists who were once art's
quirky Young Turks came to mature fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
This gratifying harvest was probably best symbolized by a man who is not a
painter or a sculptor but an architect. Frank Gehry has long been the L.A. art
world's architect -- openly and deeply influenced by everybody from Billy Al
Bengston to Robert Irwin. His year began with a traveling retrospective at the
Museum of Contemporary Art. It was a triumph of exhibition design including
recreations of copper-clad spiral rooms, a walk-in fish used as an office by
somebody with Jonah-in-the-whale fantasies, cardboard tables and chairs that
looked like bats wearing bearskin coats, all wonderfully imaginative and gently
tough.
</P>
<P>
The next thing you knew, Gehry was the centerpiece of a New York exhibition
god-fathered by Philip Johnson. Titled "Deconstructivist Architecture," it
placed Gehry at the wellspring position among an international group searching
for ways to revivify the modernist structural vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
By year's end, architectural critics had praised him as the most important
practitioner in the country. He became a rare prophet in his own land when he
finally received a commission for a key cultural building, the Disney Pavilion
at the Music Center.
</P>
<P>
No discouraging word was heard around Gehry's apotheosis. Clearly deserved, it
was nothing but justice done.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the year was punctuated with echoes of the L.A. aesthetic coming to
mature ripening. David Hockney's retrospective at LACMA found the transplanted
Brit intelligent, urbane, witty and curious. This artist, who virtually created
L.A.'s own hedonistic image of itself -- reflected in the whiplash ripples of
its pools -- left us a lot to ponder. Hockney -- sometimes seen as a
lightweight who fritters away his gifts on opera sets and Polaroid montages --
can no more be denied the underlying seriousness of his purpose than could Noel
Coward.
</P>
<P>
As the months rolled by, the sense of L.A. coming into its own just kept on
blossoming. There were external events such as the opening of LACMA's pavilion
for Japanese Art. Housing Joe D. Price's superb collection of Edo period
painting in an imaginative and apt building by the late Bruce Goff provided a
curiously exotic harmonic to LACMA's diverse architectural styles. Curator
Stephanie Barron confirmed her expertise and originality in the exhibition
"German Expressionism, The Second Generation."
</P>
<P>
But artists -- L.A. artists -- managed to hold center stage. Bengston's
retrospective, still on view at LACMA, added itself to Hockney, and a look back
at Richard Diebenkorn's works on paper headed this way in March from New York.
There is an unexpected overlap in their work, in its shared tropical pastel
palette and fundamental concern with timeless questions of drawing and
composition. They share a degree of calm mastery.
</P>
<P>
Count in the sculptor Robert Graham, whose LACMA showing of his monument to
Duke Ellington found him more flexible and more calmly assured than ever.
</P>
<P>
But it was old Ed Moses who came sidewinding out of the chute like a buckaroo
on a stoned pony. Paintings seen at L.A. Louver certainly constituted the
commercial gallery show of the year, with their crazy Pollock-ribbons of paint
kicking open deep space with all the control of a Frank Stella. If a full-dress
Moses retrospective is not in the works, there just ain't no justice.
</P>
<P>
And it was not just The Boys who came up smiling. L.A.'s enduring maverick's
maverick Joyce Treiman was reviewed in a USC exhibition. Her classic painterly
realist diary of haunted art fantasies and spiritual insight revealed new
depths to even her closest observers.
</P>
<P>
And LACMA tipped our hat to Helen Lundeberg, who was painting around here when
our ranking patriarchs were still on tricycles.
</P>
<P>
It left us all knowing that making real art takes a long time. This amazing
payoff represents at least three decades of artistic ripening. It was all begun
when things were very focused around here. People who paid attention knew all
the artists who counted and followed their work in great detail. The people who
made the work had anybody's normal dreams of recognition and reward, but they
were going to make their art if it meant two-bit second jobs and a lifetime of
spaghetti and cheap red wine.
</P>
<P>
In today's sprawling, overpopulated, fast-buck climate, where good artists cave
in to making corporate decoration and careers blaze and fizzle like flat-tire
flares, it's hard to know where a comparable generation is going to come from
in 2025. Art goes on. That there is still serious purpose out there somewhere
was well attested by the Anselm Kiefer survey at MOCA. There's always hope, but
the future has a formidable task of sorting ahead.
</P>
<P>
Funny how nice stuff manages to happen in a climate where every charge of
vulgarized art and popularized museums is absolutely true. And yet they keep
managing to engage us deeply with revelatory revivals, such as LACMA's current
Guido Reni exhibitions, or with once-in-a-lifetime extravaganzas, such as the
Metropolitan's Degas exhibition or the pageant of Paul Gauguin at the National
Gallery.
</P>
<P>
Proves there are still good people out there doing the right thing. Proves that
no matter how fetid the climate, art is still great stuff.

VENEZUELA WILL DELAY PAYING DEBT PRINCIPAL
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a surprise move, the outgoing president of Venezuela said Saturday that the
fourth-biggest debtor in Latin America is suspending principal payments on
nearly all of its $30.3-billion debt to foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
The move was not as drastic a step as halting interest payments, but it
highlights a hardening of attitudes among Latin American leaders over the
worsening economic situation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enormous Toll Reflected
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, a leading oil exporter, has been a model debtor nation and was the
only big Latin American debtor to continue making principal payments through
the 1980s. But the decision Saturday reflects the enormous toll being taken on
Latin American countries by huge debt payments to foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
The debt crisis, which is entering its seventh year, has choked off growth in
many Latin American economies as earnings are devoted to paying foreign debt
instead of financing local growth. Latin American leaders have warned that
declining living standards threaten the region's political stability and its
fledgling democratic governments.
</P>
<P>
President-elect George Bush said in December that he will order a major review
of current U.S. strategy for dealing with Third World debt. He told reporters
that "we've got enormous problems, particularly in our own hemisphere, with
Third World debt."
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide television address announcing the Venezuelan suspension of
payments, President Jaime Lusinchi said, "The problem of foreign debt today
strangles the economic and social development of the great majority of the
world's peoples."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oil Revenue Slump
</P>
<P>
He said he had ordered the suspension, effective Jan. 17, because of the slump
in revenue from oil exports and what he said were high interest rates on the
debt. Lusinchi said that Venezuelan officials plan to meet soon with their
leading creditor banks to negotiate new terms on the loans.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. banker familiar with Venezuela's position said the country wants to
reduce its loan payments by stretching out the terms of its existing loans.
</P>
<P>
Between 35% and 40% of the $30.3 billion is owed to U.S. banks. Chase Manhattan
Bank in New York is Venezuela's leading U.S. lender. San Francisco-based Bank
of America is the second-largest creditor, with $1.1 billion in long-term and
medium-term loans.
</P>
<P>
Donald K. Crowley, a banking industry analyst in the San Francisco office of
the investment firm of Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, said the suspension's
impact on U.S. banks would be minimal because none is overexposed in Venezuela.
But he said the Venezuelan action came as a shock and would be significant if
it represented a move among Latin American nations to adopt a common approach
to dealing with foreign creditors, which would give them more bargaining
leverage.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Colombia's Suspension
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Colombia said for the first time that it was suspending payment on
its $16.5-billion foreign debt for three months until a new $1.7-billion
international loan is received.
</P>
<P>
Louis G. Schirano, an executive in the New York offices of Los Angeles-based
First Interstate Bancorp., said he did not interpret the Venezuelan move as a
major setback. He said that Venezuela, which will continue paying interest on
its debt, has simply joined the other Latin debtors in suspending its principal
payments.
</P>
<P>
"What banks really care about is the debt service (interest) and that will
still be flowing," said Schirano, whose bank has divested itself of all
Venezuelan debt.
</P>
<P>
Latin America's largest debtor nations are Brazil, $113 billion; Mexico, $108
billion; and Argentina, $54 billion. Unlike Venezuela, all three have halted
interest payments to foreign banks at various times.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debt Action Urged
</P>
<P>
The presidents of all four nations, along with three other Latin American
countries, have urged the United States to make the debt problem a major
political priority. Bush's remarks about reviewing U.S. efforts have been
interpreted in some quarters as a move to possibly forgive some portion of the
huge debt owed to private banks by Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
The previous U.S. strategy for dealing with the problem, the so-called Baker
Plan, was designed in 1985 by then-Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, who
will be Bush's secretary of state. He called for commercial banks and the World
Bank to provide new loans in return for growth-oriented economic changes in the
debtor nations.
</P>
<P>
But new lending has been rare. The 17 countries that are most deeply in debt
owe $529 billion and paid $14 billion more to creditors than they received in
new loans in 1987, the latest year for which figures are available.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. development organization said in September that commercial banks should
forgive at least 30% of the amount owed by the 15 most heavily indebted Third
World countries. The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development said that was the
only way of giving the nations the opportunity to retain enough capital to grow
faster and repay the remainder of the debt.
</P>
<P>
While Venezuela's economy is in better shape than that of most of the other
debtors, the sharp two-year decline in oil prices has caused problems.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the government raised tariffs sharply to restrain imports and
conserve its cash reserves. Tariffs were increased as much as 160% on about 500
consumer items, ranging from electronics to liquor.

WASHINGTON
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the time, Republican presidential contender Ronald Reagan called it "a
shabby, needless blow." His intra-party rival, George Bush, branded it "an
abject American retreat." And then-Sen. John Tower (R-Tex.) termed it
"unconscionable."
</P>
<P>
Despite such criticism, 10 years ago today, on Jan. 1, 1979, the Jimmy Carter
Administration broke formal U.S. ties with Taiwan and established diplomatic
relations with the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
"We are recognizing a simple reality," President Carter said.
</P>
<P>
But, as a matter of American foreign policy, it had been anything but simple.
For nearly three decades, the United States had refused to recognize the
Communist regime in Beijing and had pretended that the Chinese Nationalists on
Taiwan were the government for all of China.
</P>
<P>
Now, 10 years later, the entire relationship between the United States and
China has changed. New assumptions govern the behavior of both nations, and
U.S. scholars predict that in the next few years the two governments may find
themselves in increasing conflict with one another on a number of foreign
policy questions, such as the Middle East and Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that China and the United States won't be as close as they were
before," said Thomas W. Robinson of the American Enterprise Institute. "There
has to be a certain distancing on both sides."
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, during the last decade the U.S. recognition of Beijing -- and
its avoidance of official dealings with Taiwan -- has become an established,
accepted fact in American domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
President Reagan, once one of Taiwan's closest friends in American politics,
honored the U.S. recognition of Beijing last month by saying he is confident
that the United States and China will "forge even stronger ties and build a
safer, more prosperous world." Taiwan, meanwhile, has managed to survive and
prosper despite its diplomatic isolation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Longer in Tandem
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the United States and China no longer operate in close
tandem with one another in international affairs in the way that they did a
decade ago. The common bond of shared opposition to the Soviet Union has frayed
as the United States and China separately seek warmer ties with the government
of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
"There is an increasing sense that the era in which the bilateral relationship
(between the United States and China) was based importantly on opposition to
Moscow has ended," University of Washington Prof. Nicholas R. Lardy wrote
recently.
</P>
<P>
During the last two years the United States and China have been at odds over a
number of issues.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chinese Arms Sales an Issue
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials voiced bitter complaints about China's arms sales to the Middle
East, including the sale of Silkworm anti-ship missiles to Iran and
intermediate-range ballistic missiles to Saudi Arabia. China took umbrage at
U.S. congressional resolutions denouncing China's policies on human rights and
in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
As if to symbolize the current atmosphere of mistrust, China recently imposed
new travel restrictions on American diplomats working at consulates in the
Chinese cities of Shenyang and Shanghai. The United States called these curbs
"unreasonable" and countered by slapping new limits on personnel at the Chinese
Consulate in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
That sort of reciprocal nastiness would have been unthinkable 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In the first place, the United States and China did not even have any diplomats
living and working in the heartland of each other's territory. Second, both
nations were eager to set aside all sources of conflict at the time to work
together against the perceived Soviet threat.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wanted Strategic Partner
</P>
<P>
"The United States didn't have too much choice," said one West European
diplomat who follows Chinese affairs. "China was looking for a strategic
partner against the Soviet Union. It found two countries who were willing to
play the game: Japan and the United States."
</P>
<P>
Although President Richard M. Nixon had moved to normalize ties with Beijing
during his historic 1972 visit to China, neither he nor his successor,
President Gerald R. Ford, was able to establish diplomatic relations with the
Communist regime. They were never able to overcome the strong support for
Taiwan's Nationalist regime in the right wing of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
Consider, for example, the time then-Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) resorted to
strong-arm tactics against Ford and Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
One day in May, 1976, Goldwater sent a private ultimatum to the Ford White
House. He said he had heard a radio report that the Ford Administration was
planning to establish diplomatic relations with "Red China," either before or
after the November elections.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Don't Intend to Stay Quiet'
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make any sense to me to forgo our friends on Taiwan and I don't
intend to stay quiet about it, so please within 24 hours let me know what the
truth is, and I mean the truth," Goldwater wrote. He threatened to withdraw
political support for Ford, who was then being challenged by Reagan for the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
According to files at the Gerald R. Ford presidential library, Ford and
Kissinger were forced to cave in. Within a day, Kissinger called Goldwater and
gave him the assurances that were necessary to avoid a public dispute.
</P>
<P>
It was left to Carter, a Democratic President, to take the political heat of
recognizing China, and he, too, delayed doing so until soon after the 1978
congressional elections. When Carter finally made the public announcement, on
Dec. 15, 1978, he was immediately savaged by conservative Republicans.
</P>
<P>
Within a month, Reagan was not only criticizing Carter's recognition of
Beijing, but also advocating "continuation of government-to-government
relations between the United States and Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reagan Brought Testy Period
</P>
<P>
Reagan's arrival in the White House precipitated a testy period in which China
was unsure how much support the new President would give to Taiwan. The tension
eased with a 1982 agreement limiting U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and, ultimately,
with Reagan's own election-year visit to China in 1984.
</P>
<P>
During that trip, the President minimized the ideological differences with
China that had once preoccupied American conservatives by referring to China as
a "so-called Communist country."
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1980s, the United States and China began to set aside -- or perhaps
postpone for the future -- their disputes over Taiwan. The two countries even
began to collaborate on a series of military exchanges, with Pentagon officials
making regular visits to China and leaders of the Chinese People's Liberation
Army touring military installations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides began to fight over other issues. China, sensitive to charges
by Third World countries that it was aligning itself too closely with the
United States, announced that it was conducting an "independent" foreign
policy. The United States began to complain about China's arms sales overseas
and to worry about China's continuing support for the murderous Khmer Rouge in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trade and Students
</P>
<P>
Whenever the two sides bicker, U.S. officials explain that ties with China
remain strong. They point to the increasing trade between the two countries --
more than $13 billion this year -- and the high number of Chinese students, an
estimated 32,000 to 40,000, being educated at American universities.
</P>
<P>
One senior Reagan Administration official said last year that China and the
United States now have a "mature" relationship, suggesting that the two
countries are like a married couple, able to withstand a good fight once in a
while.
</P>
<P>
Some American scholars found such bland explanations irritating. "If I hear one
more State Department official talk about a 'mature relationship' with China,
I'm going to scream," said Robinson. "It's as if the Chinese were juveniles
before now."
</P>
<P>
Indeed, although U.S. officials have gone to great lengths to stress the calm
and continuity in Sino-American relations, the underlying American attitudes
toward China have been changing in some significant ways during the last
decade.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deng Toured U.S.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, U.S. officials pinned their hopes for China's future largely on
China's top political leadership. Within weeks after diplomatic relations were
established in 1979, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping made a triumphal tour of the
United States. U.S. officials were effusive in their praise of Deng and the
reform program he was beginning to launch in China.
</P>
<P>
Now, Deng is 84, and some American officials and scholars have suggested
privately that he is becoming arbitrary and erratic in his leadership, in much
the same way as did Mao Tse-tung in the final years before his death in 1976.
Last spring, for example, Deng seemed to call for a lifting of price controls
and then to pull back in the face of a spurt of inflation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials are also critical of some of the Chinese leaders who may succeed
Deng. Speaking of Chinese Premier Li Peng, who was trained and educated in the
Soviet Union, one Reagan Administration official said recently: "Li Peng just
doesn't understand how a market economy works. Things won't really move in
China until after his years in power."
</P>
<P>
These days, American hopes for China seem to rest not on its political elite,
but on broader, long-range developments in Chinese society -- particularly the
tens of thousands of young students being educated in the United States and the
market-oriented economic reforms that are taking hold in China at the
grass-roots.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Divided Over Policy
</P>
<P>
At the moment, there appear to be serious divisions among American
policy-makers and scholars about how the United States should approach China in
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Some American experts say that the United States should now base its ties to
China primarily on economic cooperation and shift focus away from strategic
factors such as joint opposition to the Soviet Union. "The relationship (with
China) from the beginning has been premised far too much on anti-Soviet
factors," Lardy said.
</P>
<P>
But one Reagan Administration official, who said that he personally agrees with
this argument, acknowledged: "There are still people in senior policy ranks in
the United States who view China strictly in strategic terms."
</P>
<P>
In a recent speech in San Francisco, U.S. Ambassador to China Winston Lord
declared: "Contrary to some fashionable pundits, I strongly believe strategic
factors will remain crucial to our cooperation with China. . . . They are more
muted and nuanced than before. But our two nations share a continuing stake in
preserving global and regional balances."
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, at the time they established diplomatic relations, the United
States and China were drawn together by their eagerness to join hands against
the Soviet Union. Now, American scholars say, nothing between China and the
United States is quite so easy.
</P>
<P>
"If people want a clear, compelling basis for U.S.-China relations these days,
there just isn't going to be one," Harry Harding of the Brookings Institution
said. "Except that we are two big countries that are going to have to live with
one another."

GORBACHEV CALLS FOR 'GUMPTION' IN REFORM PUSH
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in a televised New Year's address
Saturday, called on the Soviet people to stop sitting on the sidelines and to
show greater "gumption" in pursuing his policy of economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev acknowledged that perestroika, his program to restructure Soviet
society, had raised high hopes among the citizens that had not yet been met.
The 57-year-old Kremlin leader, who took office in March of 1985, blamed
conservative forces in part for the slow pace of reform.
</P>
<P>
But, using tough language, he also said that every Soviet citizen should do
more to improve the quality of consumer goods and to end the shortages that
have typified Soviet life since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Greater Resoluteness'
</P>
<P>
"One cannot just outwit life and sit back on the sidelines," Gorbachev said.
"It is essential to act with greater resoluteness."
</P>
<P>
He said his attempt to revamp Soviet society "lends wings to real champions . .
. and gives them added energies and gumption. And this is just what we need now
most of all."
</P>
<P>
His remarks seem to respond to critics who complained bitterly to him during a
trip to Siberia in September of long -- and often unsuccessful -- waits to
obtain basic consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
Those dramatic encounters were carried on Soviet television, and Western
analysts said the complaints helped to push Gorbachev to make major
governmental changes in October, putting reform-minded supporters in positions
of power.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's year-end speech was broadcast across the country on Soviet
television just minutes before midnight and was probably widely seen. New
Year's Eve in the Soviet Union is a family holiday that traditionally includes
the exchange of gifts and the viewing of special television programs until
early morning hours.
</P>
<P>
"I do not want, and have no right, to paint a rosy overall picture," the
Communist Party leader said in the broadcast. "Perestroika gave rise to great
expectations to society, but changes are not coming as fast as we would all
like them to . . . . Demand still outstrips supply, especially when it comes to
quality goods.
</P>
<P>
"This," he added, "is explained in a large measure not only by the inertia of
the past but also by the novelty of problems and the real difficulties of
organizing life in a new way."
</P>
<P>
Letters to officials have revealed Soviet concerns about how perestroika would
affect individuals in the society where everyone is guaranteed a job and the
state subsidizes everything from bread to apartments.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Gorbachev warned that perestroika would mean greater individual
responsibility. He said the changes would include more reliance on "the
pay-your-own-way system . . . and a broadened scope for initiatives and social
enterprise."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Have to Get in the Mood'
</P>
<P>
"We all have to get into the mood for such work," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the topic of international relations, Gorbachev claimed that the Soviet
Union, acting "in the spirit of the new political thinking," was largely
responsible for the thaw in the Cold War between East and West. The Soviets
have learned to listen to the positions of other countries while still "abiding
by our own principles," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the shadows of the past are present in world politics," the Soviet
leader added. "But they are fading already. A new vision of the world is being
established."
</P>
<P>
On other subjects, Gorbachev referred briefly to the nationalist unrest that
has torn parts of the Soviet Union. At least 31 people were killed in November
in ethnic violence in the southwestern republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
"We are proceeding to another important phase of political reform, which will
aim to harmonize inter-ethnic relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke of the Dec. 7 earthquake in Armenia, which the Soviet Union has
said claimed tens of thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
"The end of the year was darkened by anguish," he said. "Our misfortune has
evoked warmth, sympathy and response around the world."

GORBACHEV AND REAGAN EXCHANGE HOLIDAY GREETINGS
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the second consecutive year, President Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev exchanged New Year's greetings for the Soviet and American people,
each saluting the sharp improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations during 1988.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of videotaped messages, each about five minutes long, for
broadcast on Soviet and American television, reflected the new ease with which
Reagan, who took office as perhaps the most anti-Communist leader in recent
U.S. history, has been dealing with the Soviet Union in general and Gorbachev
in particular.
</P>
<P>
As if recognizing this, Gorbachev said in his remarks -- a text of which was
made public Saturday by the White House -- that "Americans seem to be
rediscovering the Soviet Union -- and we are rediscovering America. Fears and
suspicion are gradually giving way to trust and feelings of mutual liking.
</P>
<P>
"Last year was rich in momentous events. It also brought many good changes in
relations between our peoples and countries," the Soviet leader added. "Today
they are more dynamic and more humane. We have become closer, and we have come
to know each other better."
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Reagan told the Soviet people, "I am confident that relations
between our two countries will continue on the positive course they have
followed in the year just ending.
</P>
<P>
"Despite our disagreements, we have been able to find some common ground," he
added, singling out human rights, arms control, regional problems and
U.S.-Soviet relations in general.
</P>
<P>
The Reagan-Gorbachev exchange was broadcast in full by ABC and NBC. CBS used
excerpts from both talks on its evening news program.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difference From Last Year
</P>
<P>
In tone and specific content, the speeches by the two leaders reflected the
positive course in relations, when compared with the addresses each delivered
one year ago. At that time, Reagan used the Soviet airwaves to gently prod the
Kremlin on such sensitive issues as human rights and regional disputes, while
giving a condensed introduction to American society that offered the Soviet
audience a glimpse of American holiday traditions and a miniature civics
lesson.
</P>
<P>
And two years ago, Gorbachev declared that after the failures of the October,
1986, summit conference in Iceland, superpower relations were too poor to
justify an exchange of New Year's greetings. So, Reagan's message that year,
broadcast on the Voice of America, was blotted out by electronic jamming in
much of the Soviet Bloc.
</P>
<P>
Reagan's 1989 message was videotaped on Dec. 15 in the White House Map Room,
before the President flew to California for a two-week vacation.
</P>
<P>
The President said that in human rights, "progress is being made in
reunification of families, freedom of people to travel as they please, and in
other areas." He also said that the halt in electronic jamming is a positive
step.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Solutions Being Found'
</P>
<P>
"In regional issues, from Afghanistan to the Persian Gulf and southern Africa,
solutions are being found to conflicts of many years' standing," Reagan said,
challenging the Soviets to join "in the effort to bring peace, democracy and
security to Central America" -- a region to which Gorbachev made no reference
in his speech.
</P>
<P>
Reagan also challenged the Soviets to go beyond the 500,000-troop cut in
conventional forces that Gorbachev announced at the United Nations on Dec. 7.
The troop reduction, Reagan said, is "certainly a step in the right direction
of correcting the imbalances in the European military situation."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Administration Change
</P>
<P>
Both the American and Soviet presidents, recognizing the change in
administrations that is about to occur in the United States, predicted that
President-elect George Bush would bring an element of continuity to the two
nations' relations.
</P>
<P>
"We can look ahead with optimism to the future of our relations. This is what
we talked about with President-elect Bush," Gorbachev said, referring to his
meeting with Bush in New York on the day of the U.N. speech.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Optimistic Approach
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address broadcast in the United States, Reagan took a
slightly less optimistic approach, stating that U.S.-Soviet relations can
continue to improve, but "we must remain sober in our estimation of our
negotiating partners and without illusion . . . about their goals and aims."
</P>
<P>
Whether seeking reduced tensions in relations with the Soviet Union or in the
Middle East, the Bush Administration will need congressional support and
"appropriate levels of defense spending," Reagan said, adding, "Trust me, I
know."
</P>
<P>
The radio address was delivered from the Palms Spring estate of Walter and
Leonore Annenberg, with whom the President and Nancy Reagan are spending the
New Year's holiday, as they have for nearly two decades. The festivities
included a black-tie New Year's Eve dinner.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Policy of Peace Paying Off'
</P>
<P>
As the New Year arrived, the President declared in the radio speech that "our
economy is healthy, our defenses are strong and our policy of peace through
strength is paying off in spades."
</P>
<P>
Reagan's optimism was tempered only by the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 on Dec.
21.
</P>
<P>
"Now if, as seems likely, our terrorists have crawled out of their hole to
threaten American lives, I can promise them this: The pledge we made to seek
out the truth and punish the guilty is a sacred one which George Bush shares,"
he said.

STATE HIGH COURT TAKES ANTICIPATED TURN TO THE RIGHT
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The widely anticipated turn to the right by the newly aligned California
Supreme Court emerged in strikingly clear form in a range of decisions issued
during 1988.
</P>
<P>
In the past, under a liberal majority led by former Chief Justice Rose
Elizabeth Bird, business, insurers and law enforcement repeatedly suffered
defeat. But last year, under a more conservative court led by Chief Justice
Malcolm M. Lucas, yesterday's losers became today's consistent winners.
</P>
<P>
The trend was underscored last week in the court's long-awaited ruling on
wrongful discharge in which the justices limited the rights of workers to sue
their employers for an unjust dismissal -- a decision with sweeping impact on a
fast-growing area of employment law.
</P>
<P>
The ruling followed the justices' far-reaching reversal last August of a 1979
landmark ruling that had allowed accident victims to bring damage suits against
the wrongdoer's insurance company for the bad-faith refusal to accept a claim.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uphold Death Sentences
</P>
<P>
On another front, the court, struggling to reduce a huge backlog of death
penalty appeals, issued 56 capital rulings in 12 months, upholding death
sentences 43 times.
</P>
<P>
In the nine years ending in January, 1987, with the departure of Bird and two
other justices defeated in the 1986 fall election, the court affirmed the death
penalty only four times in 68 rulings.
</P>
<P>
In other notable criminal law decisions last year, the court abandoned a past
ruling that had restricted the use of improperly obtained confessions, opened
the way for longer prison terms for repeat offenders and upheld a law aimed at
curbing sex offenses by prohibiting loitering at public restrooms.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the year, the justices showed little inclination to seek societal
reform through ground-breaking court decisions -- a trademark of the court for
the nearly three decades that it was under a liberal majority. The new court
looked for guidance from the U.S. Supreme Court and courts in other states and
expressed a desire to leave it to the Legislature to make bold changes in state
law.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critics Disturbed
</P>
<P>
The court's sharp turn disturbs critics who, while expecting some shift toward
judicial conservatism, had hoped the change would not be so abrupt and
wide-ranging.
</P>
<P>
"Since the Lucas court has taken over, we have had a series of decisions which
operate to deprive individuals of their economic rights while benefiting large
corporate institutions," said Steven J. Kaplan, a Los Angeles attorney who
represented the employee who brought the wrongful-dismissal case decided last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This court, at a visceral level, is much more sympathetic to the corporate
world than its predecessor," Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
Michael Laurence, director of a newly formed Death Penalty Project of the
American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, raises concern over the
record pace of capital case rulings and the court's tendency to uphold death
verdicts even though a procedural error has occurred at trial.
</P>
<P>
"I am surprised that the court is not taking a closer look at some of these
cases," Laurence said. "This court is much more willing to find an error was
harmless than was the previous court."
</P>
<P>
But the beneficiaries of the shift on the court welcome what they see as a more
balanced approach and a greater effort to clarify the law for judges, lawyers
and litigants.
</P>
<P>
"This court has a fuller appreciation of what's involved in a criminal
prosecution and a real-life grasp of how a case moves through the judicial
system," said state Chief Assistant Atty. Gen. Steve White.
</P>
<P>
"In both the criminal and civil area of the law, the court is more inclined to
be sensible about the impact of a ruling on the judicial process," White said.
"It seems much more interested in supplying guidance to all parties so we can
avoid error where possible."
</P>
<P>
In an ironic twist, the court issued several rulings in 1988 that went against
Gov. George Deukmejian, a leading critic of the Bird court who named the five
justices to the seven-member court who formed a bloc that set a new
philosophical course in the law.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taken by Surprise
</P>
<P>
This apparent assertion of independence from the influence by the Republican
governor took some observers by surprise.
</P>
<P>
The justices ruled that Deukmejian's nominee for state treasurer, Rep. Daniel
E. Lungren, could not take office with confirmation by only one house of the
Legislature; held that a commission made up of Deukmejian appointees could not
establish a "sub-minimum" wage for employees receiving tips, and twice refused
to hear a Deukmejian Administration challenge to a 1981 Bird court ruling that
struck down legislative restrictions on state-funded abortions for low-income
women.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the results in a broad range of decisions issued during the last
year signaled a marked change in direction from the old court.
</P>
<P>
In significant criminal law rulings, the court:
</P>
<P>
* Upheld three of every four death penalty verdicts it reviewed and, while
issuing no particularly far-reaching decisions, made clear that it will not
overturn death sentences because of a procedural error that, realistically,
could not have affected the outcome of the case.
</P>
<P>
* Ruled that prosecutors may use improperly obtained confessions to challenge
the truthfulness of a defendant's testimony at trial. The justices, abandoning
a 1976 ruling barring any such use of incriminating statements, said that under
Proposition 8, the 1982 victims' bill-of-rights initiative, state courts now
are bound by less-restrictive U.S. Supreme Court decisions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
* Reversed a 1986 ruling by the old court and held that trial judges may review
a wider range of court records to determine whether convicted felons may be
sentenced to longer prison terms because of previous commission of a
residential burglary.
</P>
<P>
* Held that the state Board of Prison Terms properly rescinded the impending
parole of "Onion Field" killer Gregory Ulas Powell based on new evidence that
his release could endanger public safety. The decision overturned a contrary
ruling by the Bird court in 1986 that had opened the way for the release of the
convicted murderer of a Los Angeles police officer in 1963.
</P>
<P>
* Reversing another decision under Bird, held that trial judges need not warn
jurors that eyewitness identifications of suspected criminals may be unreliable
and should be viewed with caution. The debate over the reliability of such
identifications should be left to trial counsel and expert witnesses to argue
before the jury, the justices said.
</P>
<P>
* Upheld the constitutionality of a state law making it a crime to loiter near
a public restroom. The court rejected arguments by civil libertarians that the
law would encourage discriminatory arrests against homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
* Allowed the prosecution for manslaughter of a Christian Scientist parent
whose child died after her mother rejected medical assistance in favor of an
attempt to heal by prayer. Parents, the court said, have no right to exercise
religious beliefs at the price of a child's life.
</P>
<P>
In major civil decisions, the court:
</P>
<P>
* Ruling in the milestone case of Los Angeles executive Daniel D. Foley, held
that an employee who is fired without good cause, in violation of a company
promise, can sue his employer only for lost pay and other economic loss.
</P>
<P>
Awards for emotional distress and punitive damages, which could range into
hundreds of thousands of dollars, may not be obtained, the justices said. More
than 1,000 wrongful discharge suits are filed annually in the state. Attorneys
predicted a sharp drop in such litigation because dismissed workers will have
less incentive to file suit and attorneys, working on a contingency-fee basis,
will be less willing to take on cases.
</P>
<P>
* Overturned a major ruling by the Bird court and held that accident victims
may not bring suit under state insurance law for the insurer's refusal to
fairly settle a claim. The court noted that the previous ruling had been widely
criticized and rejected by most other states that had considered it. In
California, the justices said, the ruling had produced confusion, inequitable
results and high litigation costs.
</P>
<P>
* Turned down a challenge by state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp to the
$10.1-billion purchase of Getty Oil by Texaco in 1984, ruling that state
antitrust law cannot be used to attack mergers by corporations.
</P>
<P>
* Upheld the constitutionality of Proposition 51, the "deep-pockets"
liability-reform initiative limiting damages for pain and suffering and other
non-economic injury in civil injury cases. However, the court, limiting the
immediate impact of the measure, ruled it will not apply to tens of thousands
of cases that were pending when it was passed by the voters in 1986.
</P>
<P>
* Gave broad protection to prescription drug makers by holding that injured
consumers cannot collect damages unless they prove that firms were negligent in
making the drugs or in failing to warn of their potential dangers. In another
victory for manufacturers, the court also held that cancer victims are not
entitled to damages for injury from the drug DES unless they filed suit within
a year after they first suspected harm from the substance.
</P>
<P>
* In a case watched closely by religious groups, ruled in a milestone "clergy
malpractice" suit that church pastors may not be held liable for the suicide of
a despondent youth to whom they had given spiritual counseling.
</P>
<P>
* Said that the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church can be sued for fraud
for allegedly "brainwashing" unknowing recruits and tricking them into joining
the church.
</P>
<P>
* Barred a single man from suing for the negligence-related death of his
live-in girlfriend, ruling that unmarried cohabitants are not entitled to the
same rights that the law gives married couples to bring such suits.

Staff members of the Miami News bid "Farewell, Miami" with their final banner
headline and a newsroom champagne toast Saturday morning as Miami's oldest
daily -- older than the city itself -- shut down.
</P>
<P>
"It's over," said Howard Kleinberg, the News' editor and an employee for 38
years. "I think we gave it a good effort."
</P>
<P>
"This isn't just another newspaper dying. It has a rich and proud history,"
Publisher David Kraslow said. "Our influence far exceeded our circulation."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Circulation Declines
</P>
<P>
The circulation of the crusading newspaper, winner of five Pulitzer Prizes, had
declined 57% in a little more than two decades to about 48,000. The owner, Cox
Enterprises Inc. of Atlanta, said it was unable to sell the News and was losing
about $28,500 a day.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department has said its antitrust division will look at the closing
and whether Cox made a serious effort to sell the newspaper. But a federal
judge Friday denied a private coalition's effort to get an injunction against
the closing.
</P>
<P>
The only apparent way to give the News a reprieve would be a Justice Department
injunction.
</P>
<P>
Cox announced in October that the newspaper would be closed Dec. 31 if it was
not sold. Under a recent amendment to a 1966 joint operating agreement with the
Miami Herald, Cox would have become responsible in 1990 for the News' operating
losses.
</P>
<P>
But Cox will continue to share in profits of the Herald, a Knight-Ridder
newspaper with a circulation of more than 400,000, through 2021 even with the
News closed. Cox will earn an estimated $300 million through the agreement, the
News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Affects News Staff
</P>
<P>
The news staff, which numbered about 105 in recent weeks, is the main staff
affected by the shutdown, since the business operation is shared with the
Herald's.
</P>
<P>
The News was born May 15, 1896, two months before the city was incorporated, as
the Miami Metropolis. It lost some readers in the 1960s with its early,
vigorous criticism of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
Even with its employees job-hunting, the News broke several stories in its
final days and was in the lead in reporting the Justice Department
investigation and criticism of its own parent company.
</P>
<P>
"It was a damn good newspaper," said columnist Mort Lucoff, 59, cleaning out
his desk after 25 years at the newspaper. "It's pretty wrenching. I put a
quarter-century of life into this newspaper."

BOMB BLAST KILLS 4 AT U.S. HOME OF BRAZILIAN EMBASSY OFFICIAL

A bomb exploded in the garage of a Brazilian Embassy lawyer early Saturday,
killing her son and three friends who apparently were tinkering with the
device, police said.
</P>
<P>
The blast, which occurred at about 3:10 a.m., blew doors and windows out of the
garage and hurled one of the youths into the driveway of the home rented by
Vera Machado, the legal counselor for the Brazilian Embassy in Washington,
police said.
</P>
<P>
They said Machado and her husband, Ronald, were asleep in an upstairs bedroom
at the time of the blast and were not injured.
</P>
<P>
One of the dead youths was identified as Gustavo Machado, 15, the couple's son.
The others were identified as Samir Gafsi, Dov Fischman and Bruno Perrone, all
either 17 or 18 years old and all college freshmen.
</P>
<P>
The three older teen-agers were described Saturday as highly intelligent,
science-oriented 1988 graduates of Bethesda's Walt Whitman High School. One of
them, Gafsi, showed a recent interest in explosives, according to his
girlfriend, Sharmi Banik.
</P>
<P>
"He was telling me about the explosion on the Pan Am jet" that crashed in
Scotland on Dec. 21 after a bomb went off, Banik said Saturday. She said Gafsi
recently told her that he and his friends could "do better than that."
</P>
<P>
Montgomery County Police Sgt. Harry Geehreng said the blast was not caused by
terrorists and appeared to be an accident. He said there was no indication the
victims had been drinking or using drugs.
</P>
<P>
He said the explosion damaged a car in the garage but there was no evidence
that a bomb had been placed in or under the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is investigating the
explosion, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Officials want to know how the device was made as well as "why was the device
made," Geehreng said. "This device was much more than ordinary fireworks."

A controversial treaty intended to eliminate all trade tariffs between the
United States and Canada over the next 10 years goes into effect today with the
exchange of diplomatic notes implementing the agreement.
</P>
<P>
President Reagan instructed Secretary of State George P. Shultz on Saturday to
dispatch the message putting the treaty into effect, the White House announced
here, where Reagan is spending the New Year's holiday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy White House press secretary Roman Popadiuk said Reagan spoke by
telephone Saturday morning with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada,
telling him, "Together, our governments have set an example for the world on
how eliminating trade barriers can benefit all peoples."
</P>
<P>
U.S. legislation approving the treaty was signed into law Sept. 28. The final
Canadian action needed to implement the treaty was taken Friday by the Canadian
Senate.

HIGH COURT SPOILED BID TO SOLVE BISHOP'S MURDER, SALVADORANS SAY
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Officials in the Salvadoran government say that the 1980 assassination of
Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero, which helped spark the nation's civil war and
caused worldwide outrage, will remain unresolved because of a Supreme Court
ruling that the testimony of a key witness is not valid.
</P>
<P>
The ruling, handed down Dec. 21, has caused an uproar in El Salvador,
escalating the already heated presidential campaign rhetoric between the
Christian Democrats of President Jose Napoleon Duarte and the rightist
Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena), the main opposition party.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the case is now closed and justice has been mocked," said Roberto
Giron Flores, who, as attorney general, was investigating the case until he was
fired Dec. 23 by the Arena-controlled National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials, who invested much time and effort in the case, were outraged by
the ruling and are making that displeasure known, but diplomatic and political
sources say the Americans acknowledge that nothing can be done to revive the
case.
</P>
<P>
Romero, a charismatic, outspoken opponent of rightist death squads and military
repression, was killed by a single shot through the heart on March 24, 1980,
while saying Mass. It was the most publicized killing of thousands carried out
by the death squads, and Duarte had vowed to punish those responsible.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. Ambassador Robert E. White asserted that the killing was ordered by
Roberto d'Aubuisson, a founder of Arena and currently a legislator in the
National Assembly. D'Aubuisson has denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
In November, 1987, Duarte made public testimony given to investigators by Amado
Garay, identified as the driver of the getaway car in the killing. Garay said
that he worked for Alvaro Saravia, a cashiered Salvadoran air force captain and
protege of D'Aubuisson. Garay said that after the killing, Saravia reported on
the success of the operation to D'Aubuisson.
</P>
<P>
D'Aubuisson declared at the time that Garay was lying and rejected the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
Based on Garay's testimony, after he passed numerous lie-detector tests and
other elements of his testimony were investigated, the Salvadoran government,
with U.S. help, asked for Saravia's extradition from Miami, where he was living
illegally.
</P>
<P>
Saravia was arrested in Miami for violating the terms of his visa, and has been
held since, as the extradition request proceeded. He was to have been
extradited in early January, according to legal sources.
</P>
<P>
But the Salvadoran Supreme Court, described by knowledgeable diplomats and
Christian Democrats as dominated by the far right, ruled Dec. 21 that there
were no grounds for arresting Saravia if he returned to El Salvador and that
the extradition request itself was illegal.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that delay in presentation of Garay's evidence, after "seven
years, seven months and 24 days, completely undermines the credibility of his
testimony" and resulted in no evidence linking Saravia to the killing.
</P>
<P>
"The problem here is that we have to understand the judicial system has been
totally dominated by Arena, which blocks the investigation and application of
justice," said Antonio Morales Erlich, secretary general of the Christian
Democrats. "I want to say as a lawyer that the witness and evidence presented
in the Romero case were ample to proceed with an arrest order."
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 23, the assembly, in its last session of the year and with only the
Arena deputies supporting the move, fired Giron Flores as attorney general,
alleging "incompetence and immorality," and named Arena sympathizer Roberto
Garcia Alvarado to replace him.
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that I was fired for a simple and fundamental reason -- because
the Romero case was about to be resolved," Giron Flores said. "Saravia was
about to return and we were going to discover who was responsible. . . . The
Romero case is now closed, and I was fired so the case could be closed."
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable observers say that Giron Flores is correct, because, by ruling
that the testimony was too old -- although no Salvadoran law places time limits
on the validity of testimony -- any new evidence or testimony will be thrown
out on the same grounds.
</P>
<P>
"On legal and procedural grounds, the case is dead," said one person familiar
with the case.
</P>
<P>
Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary bishop of San Salvador, after a Mass on
Christmas Day, said, "In the church, we think (Saravia) has valuable
information on this act which convulsed the country."
</P>
<P>
Arena's presidential candidate, Alfredo Cristiani, said that Giron Flores was
fired for "demonstrable reasons showing he was not fit to continue in office,"
and Cristiani accused the Christian Democrats of throwing up a "smoke screen"
and "politicizing" the matter by trying to link the firing to the Romero case.
</P>
<P>
The investigation into Romero's killing was being handled by a special
investigative unit that had received U.S. training. According to two people
involved in the investigation, Saravia was also to be charged upon his return
here with the kidnaping and murder in 1985 of Carlos Guerra Campos, a wealthy
coffee grower. Investigators said that they planned to use the Guerra Campos
case to force Saravia to give evidence in the Romero case.
</P>
<P>
"It was to be our checkmate move," one investigator said.
</P>
<P>
Investigators also said that Garay had identified Dr. Hector Antonio Regalado,
a dentist, as the triggerman in the murder, although they said that there was
no hard evidence other than Garay's statement linking him to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Regalado, an expert marksman, was head of security at the Constituent Assembly
when D'Aubuisson was president of that body in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, two men who worked in the assembly at that time said that
Regalado ran right-wing death squads from the building.

KHOMEINI REINS IN A HIGH-RANKING COUNCIL

The Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Saturday stripped some powers from a
high-ranking council established in February to speed up Iran's decision-making
process, Tehran Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Following criticism from parliamentary deputies and other radicals that
formation of the 13-member High Council of Expedience was unconstitutional,
Khomeini declared that it will no longer be allowed to legislate independently
of the Majlis, or Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The official radio, monitored in Nicosia, said Khomeini, Iran's supreme leader,
urged a return to constitutional law now that the need for a speedy
decision-making process has decreased since the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the war
with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Khomeini, who set up the council in February, said it should revert to its
original role -- settling disputes between Parliament and the Council of
Guardians, a panel of clergyman empowered to block laws they consider
un-Islamic.
</P>
<P>
"No problem is (now) so urgent as to be debated directly in that council
without being debated in the Majlis and being supervised by the Council of
Guardians," Tehran Radio quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new decree takes effect Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
The High Council of Expedience was founded to stop ideological arguments about
the limits of government power from blocking important legislation. It was also
authorized to issue decrees on urgent matters.

'UNWANTED CHILD' BEQUEATHS $200,000 TO SAN DIEGO PLANNED PARENTHOOD UNIT

<P>
Mark Salo, the head of Planned Parenthood here, remembers well how he met
Edward John O'Toole more than a decade ago when the frail man walked into his
office dressed in bold plaids and a baseball cap -- and clutching an airline
bag. Salo politely asked if he could be of any help to the old man.
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be the other way around. O'Toole opened his Pan Am flight bag,
and Salo found himself staring at a bundle of bonds -- $50,000 worth. "I want
Planned Parenthood to have this money," O'Toole said.
</P>
<P>
And so began a strange, 11-year acquaintanceship between Salo and the
mysterious visitor, who died recently at the age of 91 and left the Planned
Parenthood affiliate his life's fortune of nearly $200,000.
</P>
<P>
"He told me that he had been an unwanted child who had been left by his
mother," Salo said. "He never went into details, but it seemed to bother him
terribly that he had been abandoned. He didn't want that to happen to any other
child."
</P>
<P>
At O'Toole's request, Salo said, the money will be used for education programs
that stress family planning and services such as prenatal care, birth control,
sterilization and abortion.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. O'Toole was perfectly lucid," Salo said. "He said things in a
straightforward way, and told us that this is what he wanted to do."
</P>
<P>
The bequest followed an agreement reached by the two men at the first meeting
on July 7, 1977.
</P>
<P>
Salo hesitated in accepting the initial gift of bonds, suggesting that O'Toole
instead put the money in a trust that would pay him interest. Then, if O'Toole
still wanted Planned Parenthood to have his fortune, Salo told him, the
organization would graciously accept it upon his death. O'Toole then created a
trust fund with $70,000 in bonds and a life insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
Salo never did learn much about the enigmatic O'Toole, who never married and
had no children. The two men rarely met, and during the last year Salo had
heard nothing from him.
</P>
<P>
"He came into my office maybe a total of six or seven times," Salo said. "He
never wanted anything back. I would say, 'Hello, Mr. O'Toole, how are you
today?' There was some small talk, and then he left. He was a nice old man."
</P>
<P>
"In all the time I knew him, I think we spent less than three hours together,"
Salo said. "He never wanted to take up much of my time."
</P>
<P>
In early December, Salo received a note from San Diego Trust &amp; Savings.
Edward O'Toole had died Nov. 15, 1988, the note said, and Planned Parenthood
was the sole beneficiary of his trust. Bank officials say the account is worth
nearly $200,000.
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame that we don't know more about this man," Salo said. "All I know
is that he had a very unhappy childhood. He wanted people to really think about
having children."

<P>
He was arrested for investigation of conspiracy, trafficking in cocaine and
possession for the sale of cocaine. He also was held for investigation of
passing a bad check.
</P>
<P>

A Boston man charged with stealing a wedding limousine tried to escape from
custody using a gun made of soap, but he was foiled by a deputy sheriff,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Michael Callahan, 35, was being taken from a holding cell in the basement of
Dorchester District Court on Friday when he pulled the bogus gun, officers
said. Deputy Frederick Pollini disarmed him with a karate chop.
</P>
<P>
Callahan faces new charges in the escape attempt. He already is charged with
robbing a tailor shop Dec. 17, then stealing a limousine carrying a bride and
three members of the bridal party. He left the four in front of the church.

TRAINS KILL 4, INCLUDING DAREDEVIL PLAYING 'CHICKEN'

<TEXT>
<P>
Four people, including a woman on her way to work and a young man playing
"chicken" with friends, were killed by trains in Southern California, two of
them in Los Angeles County, police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the first incident, at 7 p.m. Friday, Lorenzo Ruelas, 35, of Oxnard was
killed when he was hit by an Amtrak passenger train traveling 70 m.p.h. outside
Oxnard, Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Carl Schoenberger said. It has not been
determined why Ruelas was walking on the tracks.
</P>
<P>
Two hours later Shawn James Schultz, 21, of Escondido was playing the daredevil
game "chicken" with friends when he put his head on the tracks and was struck
and killed by a southbound Amtrak train in Oceanside, Officer Lori Conway said.
</P>
<P>
The Amtrak train bound for San Diego from Los Angeles was traveling about 30
m.p.h. to 40 m.p.h. as it moved through the city about 40 miles north of San
Diego, said Police Sgt. Richard Derouen.
</P>
<P>
The friends did nothing as the engine ran over Shultz because "the object of
the game is to see how long you can stay down," Derouen explained.
</P>
<P>
At 3 a.m. Saturday a heavily tattooed man lying on railroad tracks in Sun
Valley was run over by a freight train and killed, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The train's crew told officers they saw the man as the locomotive approached
but were unable to stop in time, Sgt. William Meier said. The victim, who was
carrying no identification papers, had not been identified by late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At 6 a.m. Saturday, a woman walking to work was struck and killed by a freight
train as she stumbled and fell across tracks in El Monte, Sgt. Steve Schuster
said.
</P>
<P>
Mary Louise Johnson, 30, of Temple City was pronounced dead at the scene,
Schuster said.
</P>
<P>
Johnson was carrying a small bag containing her lunch when she stumbled while
walking across a triple-track area. She was hit when she reached to pick up the
contents of the bag, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It was still dark at the time," Schuster said. He speculated that she
misjudged the speed of the train.

OREGON TRIES TO BLOCK DEFENSE ACCESS TO ECCLESIA YOUTHS

Oregon's Justice Department has entered the legal fight over whether defense
attorneys in the upcoming manslaughter trial of four Ecclesia Athletic Assn.
members should be allowed to talk to children taken from the group by the
state.
</P>
<P>
State Appellate Division attorneys filed a request Friday that the Oregon
Supreme Court block a Dec. 7 order by Clackamas County Judge John Lowe giving
defense attorneys access to children taken from the group's rural Oregon camp.
</P>
<P>
Four adult Ecclesia members face trial Feb. 6 in Clackamas County in the Oct.
14 beating death of Dayna Broussard, the 8-year-old daughter of the Los
Angeles-based group's founder, Eldridge Broussard Jr.
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys for Willie Chambers, 35; Brian Brinson, 30; Frederick
Doolittle, 28, and Constance Jackson, 37, have sought to interview some of the
53 children taken into state protective custody at the group's farmhouse near
Sandy, east of Portland, hours after the girl's death.
</P>
<P>
The group originally organized the farm near Sandy as an athletic training
center to train inner-city youths from Los Angeles. However, state officials
have alleged that the children were subject to ritualistic abuse, some beaten
hundreds of times while the others were forced to keep count.
</P>
<P>
The state attorneys were in a race with the clock in trying to block interviews
with the children as Clackamas County prosecutors have been ordered to appear
in Circuit Court next Tuesday to show why they should not be held in contempt
of court for failing to produce the children.
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys Wednesday were granted their request for the order after
attempts to set up interviews with the children were stalled while prosecutors
waited to see if the Justice Department would review the matter.
</P>
<P>
Virginia Linder, solicitor general for the state Justice Department, said the
Supreme Court previously has ruled against trial court judges in criminal
proceedings ordering the Children's Services Division to produce children in
its custody for defense interviews or parents to produce children for the same
reason.
</P>
<P>
The question still undecided by the court is whether such judges can order
prosecutors to produce a child for interviews when the child is in state
custody, as in the Ecclesia case.

The league's secretary general, Chedli Klibi, said the cease-fire in the
Iran-Iraq War, progress on the Palestinian question and rapprochement between
North African states are other reasons for optimism.

"New avenues of hope now lie open before our nation . . . with the imminent
return of Egypt into the fold and her resumption of her great mission within

for complications after childbirth, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Denise Nicoleau and her husband, Herriot, refused the transfusions on religious
grounds Friday, and a Brookhaven Memorial Hospital official obtained a court
order to administer them.

The three arrested, including Herriot Nicoleau, were charged with second-degree
criminal trespass. Then the woman received the first transfusion, police said.

PROF. T. BLAISDELL; HELPED PLAN RECOVERY OF POSTWAR EUROPE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL J. YBARRA, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas C. Blaisdell Jr., whose half-century of public service and scholarship
included a prominent role in planning the reconstruction of postwar Europe,
died Tuesday. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
Blaisdell was a distinguished professor of political science at UC Berkeley who
continued teaching long after assuming emeritus status in 1963.
</P>
<P>
After a long career in public service starting in the New Deal era and
culminating in his leadership in helping plan European recovery after World War
II, Blaisdell joined the UC Berkeley faculty in 1951.
</P>
<P>
Active in publishing and lecturing well into retirement, Blaisdell taught
freshman seminars in political science and international relations as recently
as last year.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1895 in Pittsburgh, Pa., Blaisdell graduated from Pennsylvania State
College in 1916. He earned a master's degree in social history at Columbia
University in 1922 and his doctorate there in 1932. He taught at Columbia from
1925 to 1932.
</P>
<P>
In 1933, Blaisdell went to Washington to join Franklin D. Roosevelt's "brain
trust" in the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. Over the next two
decades, he held a number of federal positions, working first on helping the
nation recover from the Depression and then on European postwar reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Blaisdell was assistant secretary of commerce during the Administration of
President Harry S. Truman.
</P>
<P>
Although he was modest about his role in postwar European recovery, colleagues
have called him one of the principal architects of the Marshall Plan,
proclaimed in 1947 by Secretary of State George C. Marshall.
</P>
<P>
A widely published author, Blaisdell's best known work was "The American
Presidency in Political Cartoons." Written with Peter Selz, a Berkeley art
history professor, the 1976 book received wide acclaim.
</P>
<P>
No services have been set.
</P>
<P>
The family asked that donations be sent to the Fund for Cal in the Capital, the
Young Musicians Program, both at UC Berkeley, or the Harry S. Truman Institute
in Independence, Mo.
</P>
<P>
Blaisdell is survived by a son, Thomas; a brother, William; two grandchildren
and two great-grandchildren.

SOVIET DISSIDENT YULI DANIEL; IMPRISONED FOR PUBLISHING ABROAD

Yuli Daniel, a satirist and poet whose 1966 trial with Andrei Sinyavsky was a
worldwide sensation and marked the beginning of a long crackdown on dissidents,
died at his home Friday, his former wife said.
</P>
<P>
Larisa Bogoraz, a veteran of the Soviet dissident movement who was Daniel's
wife when he was sentenced to five years in prison and labor camp, said he died
of a stroke. Daniel was 63 and had been in ill health for years.
</P>
<P>
Daniel's most famous work, "This is Moscow Calling," satirically called for a
"Public Murder Day," in which Soviets over the age of 16 would be allowed to
kill someone as long as it was not a policeman or a public transport worker.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Published Under Glasnost
</P>
<P>
Under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or greater
openness, some of Daniel's works written in prison camp were published in
Moscow in July as he lay in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
Daniel and Sinyavsky, conscious of the ostracism of Nobel Prize-winning author
Boris Pasternak for publishing his novel "Doctor Zhivago" abroad, used the
pseudonyms Nikolai Arzhak and Abram Terts, respectively, to publish their works
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Despite persecution of writers such as Pasternak, Premier Nikita S.
Khrushchev's years were relatively free for writers, and came to be known as
"The Thaw."
</P>
<P>
But Daniel and Sinyavsky were arrested in the autumn of 1965, less than a year
after Khrushchev was ousted by a group of Kremlin leaders from which Leonid I.
Brezhnev eventually would emerge as the most powerful.
</P>
<P>
Daniel received a five-year term in prison and labor camp for illegally
publishing his works abroad, and Sinyavsky was sentenced to seven years. It was
the first time that criminal charges were brought against Soviet intellectuals
for literary criticism of the Soviet system.
</P>
<P>
Dissidents, KGB agents and foreign correspondents huddled outside the Moscow
courtroom where they were tried, and rushed to get word of the proceedings when
the defendants' wives would come out during breaks. News of the trial was
broadcast back into the Soviet Union by foreign radio stations.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin followed their trial with a long and determined crackdown on
dissidents and unofficial publications, but during the late 1960s unofficial
publications and the number of dissidents grew nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ended Dissident Activities
</P>
<P>
Daniel lived and worked in Kaluga and Moscow after he finished his prison term,
but did not take part in further dissident activities. Sinyavsky emigrated to
Paris after serving his term.
</P>
<P>
The publication Ogonyok, in printing Daniel's prison camp poetry, called him a
"war veteran and man of difficult fate."
</P>
<P>
Included in the poems published in July was "The Ring," in which Daniel
appeared to be describing his trial as a boxing match.
</P>
<P>
Bogoraz said that Daniel was survived by his wife, Irina Uvarova, a son and
grandson.

THE 4 FRESHMEN;
</P>
<P>
VISION OF COALITION COMES UNRAVELED
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One year ago, their election began the most complete overhaul of the San Diego
City Council in a decade. Four educated, ambitious, politically savvy men --
they were the first group to take their seats together as newcomers since 1977.
</P>
<P>
They were instantly nicknamed The Four Freshmen, and they almost as quickly
predicted that they could become a force on the nine-member council.
</P>
<P>
"We're going into office as a coalition of sorts," District 8 Councilman Bob
Filner said the day after he was elected with the 2nd District's Ron Roberts,
4th District's Wes Pratt and 6th District's Bruce Henderson. "People may wonder
how or where the mayor and the current council members might get votes from us.
But, on the other hand, with four of us coming in, we only need to pick up one
vote to do what we want to."
</P>
<P>
As Filner could best attest, it has not worked out that way. The freshmen's
political differences soon dashed any semblance of a coalition forged in the
heat of the campaign, and their fortunes have followed divergent paths.
</P>
<P>
But each began to carve a niche for himself as the council fought and lost the
battle to rein in growth, confirmed a new police chief, selected a site for a
new Civic Center, grappled with an expensive sewage problem, authorized yet
another study of how to relocate the airport, endorsed Mayor Maureen O'Connor's
Soviet arts festival and raised hotel taxes to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
Here is a look, in district order, at the Four Freshmen's first two semesters.
</P>
<P>
The day after he was elected, District 2 Councilman, Ron Roberts promised to
"hit the ground running." These days, it is said around City Hall, Roberts is
running -- for mayor.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Friend to All Issues
</P>
<P>
Roberts, whose district stretches from Point Loma to Mission Hills, greets
returning warships, fires starter's pistols at track meets, cuts ribbons,
accepts awards and gives speeches. His energy is so boundless, his presence so
ubiquitous, his name in the news so often, that it is difficult to remember he
has been on council only a year.
</P>
<P>
Roberts has yet to meet an issue he doesn't like. Whether it is growth
management, safety and noise at Lindbergh Field or sewage treatment and water
reclamation, Roberts has studied it, and he has a plan for improving it.
</P>
<P>
More than any of the four new council members -- perhaps more than any other
council member except Gloria McColl -- Roberts has nimbly stepped into the
power vacuum created by the city's weak mayor form of government and O'Connor's
hands-off leadership style.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mixed Reviews
</P>
<P>
At year's end, he had positioned himself in a tenuous coalition of five
moderate-to-conservative Republicans that could dominate the nine-member
council if its members can overcome longstanding differences among them. At the
same time, he remains close to O'Connor, who endorsed only him among the eight
candidates in the 1987 election.
</P>
<P>
Some of Roberts' adventures have backfired. An attempt to remove the city's
highly successful Motion Picture and Television Bureau from the Chamber of
Commerce led to an embarrassing defeat and ill will from the chamber. "I would
do that differently if I had it all to do over again," he said.
</P>
<P>
Slow-growth activists, who had high hopes for Roberts when O'Connor endorsed
him as "someone who knows how to say 'no' to developers," now consider him the
architect of some of Proposition H's worst features.

<P>
"Ron Roberts talks like Mr. Rogers but votes like Attila the Hun," was a
standard campaign stump line from Citizens for Limited Growth's Peter Navarro.
</P>
<P>
Roberts deftly handles speculation about his ambition. "The things I'm doing
are because that's how I interpret the job of being on the council. If there
is, at a later date, a reward in citizens
</P>
<P>
saying, 'We're willing to to let you step up to a higher office,' that's fine."
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, who this month began a new four-year term in office, has heard the
whispers about Roberts' ambition but is unconcerned.
</P>
<P>
"I have to tell you, I think they're all running for mayor. Everybody's running
for mayor. Secretly, and I'll talk generically, any council member who serves
as a council member has kind of a little, secret desire to one day be mayor,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
"My philosophy is 'good government is good politics,' " she added, "I work
hard, I try to serve the community well. It's their choice. What will be will
be."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High-Profile Concerns
</P>
<P>
Blessed with intelligence, drive and an All-American, good-guy personality,
Roberts has benefited from the fact that the issues he is best able to tackle
are among the city's most high-profile concerns.
</P>
<P>
Roberts' district includes Lindbergh Field, so he is a natural to work on the
pressing matters of noise and safety at the airport -- issues watched closely
throughout the region. Point Loma is home to the city's only sewage treatment
plant, so Roberts has become outspoken on the city's need for a $1.5-billion
upgrading of its sewer-treatment system, and, more specifically, on the need to
develop water reclamation technology.
</P>
<P>
As an architect and former chairman of the Planning Commission, Roberts was
installed as chairman of the committee that wrote Proposition H, the council's
growth-management plan. He became the leading spokesman for it during the
unsuccessful election campaign.
</P>
<P>
But Roberts' success is mostly of his own making. He worked with Point Loma
residents and the Port District to fashion the compromise plan approved this
month that will limit noise from takeoffs and landings at Lindbergh. He has
ridden in an airplane cockpit to assess the danger, if any, posed by the Laurel
Travel Center building at the foot of the airport runway. He is involved in
discussions with the Navy to reshape the landscape at the foot of Broadway.
</P>
<P>
Somehow, Roberts finds time for his district. He has worked to revitalize Ocean
Beach and is helping Point Loma's planning board devise ways to lessen
peak-hour traffic, caused largely by sailors, on Catalina Boulevard and
Rosecrans Street.
</P>
<P>
"That man is working day and night," said Ann Jackson, chairman of the
Peninsula Community Planning Board. "I feel very fortunate that he chose to
leave the architectural profession and try serving the city and the community.
He's doing a wonderful job."
</P>
<P>
Roberts points to a new downtown plan, a new waterfront plan, the
growth-control debate and the airport as his major issues in 1989. He also will
be heavily involved in the council's redistricting efforts and is rumored to
want to add a chunk of downtown to his district.
</P>
<P>
Wes Pratt took office, took one look at the crying needs in his impoverished
council district and took to the streets of Southeast San Diego. He lectures
schoolchildren on the evils of drugs, marches to protest gang violence and goes
door-to-door exhorting homeowners in the battle against crack dealers.
</P>
<P>
Long before district elections were approved by voters in the November, Pratt,
the council's lone black member, focused his energy on the concerns of his
largely minority constituents in the 4th District, which includes Southeast San
Diego, Encanto, Paradise Hills and most of the California 94 corridor. If that
meant that his colleagues would grab the limelight, so be it.
</P>
<P>
"I decided I would simply concentrate on district-related issues and getting
out into the district," he said.
</P>
<P>
His record is true to that decision. In his first year, Pratt sought more money
for social services to AIDS victims, a growing concern of the minority
community. He championed the losing Charter Review Commission ballot initiative
for a tough police review board and was critical of the police shooting of
Tommie Dubose during an arrest.
</P>
<P>
He was actively involved in the negotiations to sell Southeast's San Diego
Physicians &amp; Surgeons Hospital, and at year's end was leading the effort to
have the city's Convention Center named for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the
slain civil rights leader
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staying Above the Fray
</P>
<P>
Pratt has developed a reputation for staying above the fray on City Hall's 10th
floor, where the deal-cutting and alliance-building among council members can
be fast-paced. That stance has allowed Pratt to acquire some power as a
somewhat unpredictable swing vote on the nine-member council. It was Pratt, for
example, who came back from his sickbed to break a 4-4 tie on the size of the
increase of the city's hotel room tax.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't ask to be in that position," he said. "It's just the way I conduct
myself in the City Council is to be pretty straightforward and not ally myself
with one faction or another."
</P>
<P>
Herb Cawthorne, executive director of the San Diego Urban League, believes
Pratt "has done an exceptional job. He's surprised a lot of people with his
ability to grasp the larger issues. He has a tremendous amount of pressure on
him, because his balance makes him the swing factor a lot of times.
</P>
<P>
"I think, as he matures, he will learn to exercise the power in more
far-reaching ways," Cawthorne added.
</P>
<P>
George Stevens, an aide to Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) and Pratt's opponent in
the council race, praises Pratt for his stand on the police review issue and
for his responsiveness to neighborhood needs.
</P>
<P>
But Stevens believes that Pratt should be supporting a committee recommendation
to include King's full name in the convention center title instead of Pratt's
proposal of "San Diego King Convention Center." And he believes Pratt should
have gotten an even larger share of this year's Community Development block
grant money than the $2 million his district received.
</P>
<P>
A rare politician who does not feel the need to give extended speeches before
each vote, the quiet, burly Pratt has earned the respect of colleagues with his
allegiance to doing what is right.
</P>
<P>
"Wes Pratts don't come along very often," said Mayor Maureen O'Connor. "He's
got a rare quality about him." And "99% of the time he's on the side of the
angels," she added.
</P>
<P>
"I basically want to be about the business of good government," Pratt said. "I
will continue to do that. I don't feel I have to wave a big flag. Wes Pratt is
not going to be here forever. People have to take up the mantle and serve."
</P>
<P>
Bruce Henderson has taken a prominent role in some important citywide and
district issues. Henderson was the architect of Proposition K, the advisory
ballot measure calling for a mandatory, citywide program of staggered work
hours to reduce peak-hour traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
Along with several other council members, he has championed an ordinance to
preserve single-family neighborhoods, which make up a sizable part of his 6th
District, which includes Pacific Beach, Mission Beach and Clairemont. He led
the fight to equip the city's police force with two helicopters captured from
drug runners. One chopper is now operating and the other is being outfitted.
</P>
<P>
Henderson continues to be the council's maverick on its $1.5-billion sewer
system upgrade, insisting that the effort is not necessary. He also led
opposition to a $1.5-million consulting contract to publicize the issue,
narrowly losing his effort to sharply reduce the program, but managing to pare
$300,000 from the price tag.
</P>
<P>
Despite that sizable first-year agenda, Henderson is best known inside City
Hall for the publicity stunts, his long, sometimes unfocused speeches and his
class-clown tendency to interrupt colleagues during council sessions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blowup Sharks, Posters
</P>
<P>
Henderson has filled the council chamber with the ominous background music from
the film "Jaws" and adorned the room with inflatable sharks to make his point
that "consultant sharks" are feeding on public tax dollars. He altered a "Jaws"
poster to show the shark munching a dollar bill.
</P>
<P>
His "Fly Me" poster focused attention on the helicopters. He handed out a
commuter survival kit at a press conference to exhort voters to approve
Proposition K.
</P>
<P>
Henderson has "a sense of humor, a different way of doing things," said
O'Connor, who concedes she has at times become exasperated trying to silence
Henderson at council meetings. "He has fun and doesn't take it personally. . .
. He does make you laugh.
</P>
<P>
"He tries to exaggerate to make his point. And, through his exaggerations, he
makes his points. That's his way of doing it."
</P>
<P>
Henderson agrees that he's trying "just to have a little fun" during council
meetings that can stretch eight hours or more.
</P>
<P>
"The sharks captured the council's attention," he said. "I didn't win, but at
least I saved the city $300,000."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Admits to 'Fine Line'
</P>
<P>
But, he acknowledges, "I have to be careful because there's a fine line between
using them and amusing (council members) and over-using them and irritating
(council members)."
</P>
<P>
Behind the clowning, council members agree, is a keen mind and a financial
acumen that many other council members lack. Henderson has also concentrated on
his district, focusing on a traffic study of Mission Bay, Pacific Beach and La
Jolla and closely scrutinizing requests for exemptions from the city's Interim
Development Ordinance in his neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
He has also maneuvered himself into the chairmanship of the Public Facilities
and Recreation Committee, where he will have a more direct impact on Mission
Bay Park.
</P>
<P>
Henderson was perhaps the council's most outspoken opponent of the
growth-management plan, though he did vote for it after weeks of negotiation.
"I didn't like H . . ., " he said of Proposition H. "I was very pleased by the
voters, that they rejected it." Henderson called the voters' decision "a
reaffirmation of representative democracy," because it put the future of growth
management back in the council's hands.
</P>
<P>
Henderson, "I think, has been less of an environmental supporter than we had
expected," said Barbara Bamberger, the Sierra Club's conservation coordinator.
"And we didn't expect much."
</P>
<P>
This has not been Bob Filner's month.
</P>
<P>
It started Nov. 29 when a coalition of five council members relieved him of
$1.7 million in Community Development block grant funds that City Manager John
Lockwood had recommended for his 8th District. The following day, the same
group turned down O'Connor's suggestion that Filner head a council committee
and installed Henderson as chairman instead.
</P>
<P>
A week later, they were at it again, refusing to allow Filner to represent the
council on the Metropolitan Transit Development Board.
</P>
<P>
Filner's colleagues say they were trying to teach him a lesson. They say he is
abrasive, that he takes political and philosophical debate and raises it to the
level of personal attack.
</P>
<P>
"Bob tends to personalize it: 'you're evil, you're bad, you're mean, you've
broken the law, and I don't like you, and I'm going to take my football and go
home,' " Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
Roberts, one of the group of moderate-to-conservative Republicans who
engineered Filner's thrashing, claims he was motivated by Filner's attempt,
during back-corridor wrangling over committee chairmanships, to put together a
slate that would have left Roberts without a chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Convenient Target?
</P>
<P>
Filner remains defiant, claiming that the group he has dubbed "the Gang of
Five" was motivated by common ideological and political goals, not personal
ones. As perhaps the council's most liberal member, Filner believes he makes a
convenient target.
</P>
<P>
"The defeat of the H and J has emboldened the pro-development forces on the
council," he said, referring to council members Ron Roberts, Bruce Henderson,
Judy McCarty, Ed Struiksma and Gloria McColl. "I think that's what is behind
some of the recent votes with the Gang of Five.
</P>
<P>
"There's an ideological, partisan effort to make sure I am kept weak," he said.
</P>
<P>
He does not deny trying to put together a slate of committee chairmen without
Roberts on it. "Why is my attempting to put together a slate that's helpful to
me any worse or better than his trying to put together a slate that's
beneficial to him?," he asked.
</P>
<P>
The answer is that Roberts had the votes to win and Filner didn't. Votes are
the bottom line, said Andrea Skorepa, executive director of a San Ysidro social
service agency and a Filner antagonist who supported his opponent, Mike
Aguirre, in the most recent election.
</P>
<P>
"I think, for our community, he hasn't been as effective a representative as he
could be," she said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the year, Filner watched helplessly as the council overruled his
recommendation and gave a publicly run recreation center in his district to
Skorepa's organization.
</P>
<P>
The internal conflict has overshadowed Filner's accomplishments in his large,
meandering district, which stretches from Hillcrest through downtown and
includes San Ysidro and Otay Mesa. A fanatical worker, he is perhaps the
council's most cerebral member, who has a tendency to intellectual honesty even
if his views are not politically popular. He is on leave from San Diego State
University, where he teaches history.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Concerns
</P>
<P>
Filner was the only council member to oppose placing Charter Commission
initiatives directly on the ballot without review, arguing that the position
was an abdication of the council's responsibilities. In recent months, some of
his colleagues have begun to agree.
</P>
<P>
Filner guided the Balboa Park Master Plan to adoption, insisting that it call
for maximizing open space. He has brought capital improvement funds to South
Bay parks and worked on the revitalization of San Ysidro Boulevard. Last month
he called for higher taxes to put more police on city streets.
</P>
<P>
Filner has proven himself one of the council's most ardent slow-growth
advocates and remains a solid pro-environment vote. He has defended the Sierra
Club from attempts to oust the organization from its Balboa Park office.
</P>
<P>
"Bob Filner is one of the few consistent supporters, who has been out there and
has been aggressively fighting for the preservation of open space and sensitive
lands," said the Sierra Club's Bamberger.
</P>
<P>
Filner pledged to soften his tone if it will mean more success for his
district, which could be vulnerable in next year's redistricting.
</P>
<P>
"I'm willing to look at my own behavior," he said. "If it's hurting me from
achieving things for my district, that will change."
</P>
<P>
But he adds: "I'm an outspoken person. I represent a district that has
historically been powerless. I'm going to continue to (be outspoken). If that
gets me into trouble, so be it."

SUPPORT FOR SHERIFF
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was quite surprised at how uninformed the L.A. Times was in writing the
editorial on Sheriff Duffy, ("It's Time to Hear From Sheriff Duffy," Dec. 11).
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Union reported a case where an ex-deputy was cleared by a jury of
brutality. A victory for the Sheriff's Department. This jury saw through the
absurdity of this lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
It should be against the law to file frivolous lawsuits. The courts are already
overburdened. It's a waste of taxpayers' money. These claims of brutality are
probably being blown out of proportion, never occurred, or cons trying to con
the county out of money. In fact, I hope that the sheriff's deputies
countersue.
</P>
<P>
The Times says that Duffy should speak out. Well, I'm sure that the reason he
or his designated official won't say anything is that anything they say might
be detrimental to the cases. He has already won one case, and I'm sure he'll
win more without saying anything.
</P>
<P>
The Times wants to consider a civilian review board. A law enforcement
officer's worst nightmare is to have a civilian, who is not trained in the law
enforcement procedures, who does not have to deal with the bad side of the
public, to judge whether the law enforcement officer was right or wrong. All
The Times has to do is check their stories to see that the Sheriff's Department
does "police" its own. The media have reported at least three cases, that I
know of, where sheriff's deputies were fired from the department and/or cases
taken to the district attorney for criminal charges to be filed. I say no to a
civilian review board.
</P>
<P>
In my opinion, the Sheriff's Department is doing a good job. To reiterate what
I saw on a bumper sticker, "San Diego County Sheriff -- Law Enforcement at its
Best."

A CHARGED IDEA
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An idea recently occurred to me that may be worthy of community support.
Because San Diego is considering buying out San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, how
about going ahead and acquiring the Chargers as well? Just ponder the plethora
of possibilities:
</P>
<P>
Lighting the stadium would be absolutely free, and Charger fans may be eligible
to apply for a rebate on ticket prices from the Public Utilities Commission.
</P>
<P>
As part of incentive clauses for free agents, the city/Chargers could offer
such bonuses as light bulbs, generators, consulting fees and preferred stock.
</P>
<P>
The mayor, in her spare time, could coach the team.
</P>
<P>
We could trade Tom Page and Steve Ortmayer for a Tucson utility and a
substance-abusing linebacker to be named later.
</P>
<P>
As part of the Russian arts festival, the Chargers might scrimmage with members
of the Kirov Ballet. Perhaps the San Diego Chicken could hatch out of a giant
Faberge egg during halftime and do a humorous rendition of Swan Lake.
</P>
<P>
If all this wouldn't give that mean old ogre of a Howard Allen from Southern
California Edison fits, I don't know what will. Think about it, San Diego.
SDG&amp;E and the Chargers . . . what an electric combo! Why, everybody, not
just the skinheads, could go out and paint the old town red.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT: CRUMBS FOR MIGRANTS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dec. 18 article ("Breaking Camp") relating to the housing problem of
migrant farm workers in North San Diego County was indeed upsetting, but not
surprising.
</P>
<P>
During my four years as California state director of migrant education, I had
the opportunity to visit many migrant camps and other farm worker housing
throughout the state. The impressions leave a lasting dismal memory in my mind
. . . as well as deep anger that our society can treat one segment of our
population so callously.
</P>
<P>
To the farmer, as well as the community, the workers are an implement to be
used for bringing in the crops, then to be ignored, like machinery or farm
animals. They are not perceived as human beings. . . . like you and me.
</P>
<P>
Yet they are very human . . . perhaps most of them are more decent humans than
many of us. They live in a close-knit family, loyal to each other, with high
moral values, and of deep religious beliefs. They are a proud people, unwilling
to take a "handout": welfare or social services for which they have not worked.
Crime, drug or alcohol abuse is rare in these families.
</P>
<P>
Housing is always a problem. They stay in a community for only part of a year.
Thus, permanent housing is out of the question. Rental payment for middle-class
apartments or houses is well beyond their means. So they are forced to live in
camps, caves, shacks, trailers, their cars . . . wherever. Consequently, both
they and their children tend to be of poor health, with little chance to learn
English and not accepted as part of the community.
</P>
<P>
During the '60s, over 20 camps were built for the migratory farm workers in the
central valleys of California. The funds came from the federal government to
the state, which built the camps cooperatively with the counties, which then
managed the camps that were built on land donated by farmers. These facilities
are fairly decent temporary housing, and far better than the alternative. Each
camp houses about 100 families; and several hundred are turned away each year
because supply does not meet demand.
</P>
<P>
Currently, I am on the board of directors of the Coachella Valley Housing
Coalition. We are a small, nonprofit organization, building farm worker
housing, both apartments and self-help homes. Our first two projects, built
with federal and state funds, provided very decent multi-bedroom housing for
100 families, and we are funded for an additional 140 units. Five hundred
families applied for the first 50 units. We'll keep building until all families
are out of the ditches and shacks and filthy camps . . . or until the money
runs out.
</P>
<P>
So I read about the solution used in North San Diego County: bulldoze the only
housing the farm workers have been able to provide for themselves! Assure that
14,000 workers and their families are homeless. Despite the rationalizations by
the local officials, this action is the most brutal which has yet come to my
attention.
</P>
<P>
I guess Congressman Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) speaks for the majority of the
folks in that area when he throws the responsibility for finding housing and
meeting health regulations back on the migrant workers. I wish he could spend a
few days living under their circumstances.
</P>
<P>
There are solutions. Let the growers, who need the workers, donate a few acres
each for camps. At the state level, Proposition 84 specifically provides $10
million for the construction of migrant farm labor camps. It wouldn't take
much, in terms of federal or state spending. And, provide something more decent
than the current proposal down there: a 14-foot plastic unit to house a family
of four. Unbelievable! Would Congressman Packard move his family into such a
unit?
</P>
<P>
Just think! If readers of this letter are compassionate, or if they are
Republicans who believe the private sector should solve all problems . . . if
all those readers contributed $10 each; then that money might be sufficient to
house an awful lot of workers who provide the food on our table, and who live
worse than any other segment of our population.
</P>
<P>
But then, who really cares?

LINGUISTS DELVE MANY MILLENIA INTO PAST TO FIND MAN'S MOTHER TONGUE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By UPI
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LOS ANGELES
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If this renegade group of linguists could board a time machine, they probably
would press the accelerator to the floor -- moving backward through the ages to
a time before Sanskrit, English, Punjabi or Japanese.
</P>
<P>
Hurtling back to a remote part of the past before people ever learned to farm,
past the era when humans first used fire to a period 100,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
That is the time they think they will find the critical evidence, the seedlings
that produced all of the world's languages, something they like to call the
Mother Tongue of Man.
</P>
<P>
Such a discovery, this group of mostly Soviet and East European researchers
believe, would prove what is called the monogenesis of language, the evolution
of the spoken word from a single tongue.
</P>
<P>
But while even these scientists think the 100,000-year mark could eventually
prove to be too deep in the remote past, they have made headway in
reconstructing hundreds of words they believe were spoken 15,000 to 30,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Historical linguist Vitaly Shevoroshkin of the University of Michigan in Ann
Arbor sees a host of applications for biology and anthropology in the work he
and his colleagues in the Soviet Union have done.
</P>
<P>
For one, the evolution of language not only shows "how some words have become
petrified," by not changing much over time but also how people have migrated
around the world.
</P>
<P>
Yet he laments the work has generated little interest in the West.
</P>
<P>
To hear Shevoroshkin tell it, only a handful of Americans are interested in
learning the words spoken by early Homo sapiens sapiens, the prehistoric humans
whom paleobiologists believe first appeared 100,000 years ago and are the
direct ancestors of modern people.
</P>
<P>
Shevoroshkin theorizes that it is possible to pinpoint at least a few original
words of man, elements from a language that served as the progenitor for all of
those ever spoken on Earth.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to reconstruct the proto-proto-proto language, if you will, the
Mother Tongue.
</P>
<P>
"A proto language means a language family like Indo-European. If you say
proto-proto that's an ancestor of a family, not everybody accepts that idea
especially people in the West.
</P>
<P>
"But when you say proto-proto-proto, that's something completely different.
Perhaps we may not find the mother tongue, the language of the world, maybe we
can go back only 30,000 years.
</P>
<P>
"There is a big gap between people speaking some type of language 30,000 years
ago and one spoken 100,000 years ago. That is a very big gap and we don't know
how to fill it."
</P>
<P>
As part of his quest, however, Shevoroshkin hopes to find the links that tie
the world's languages together and link them to the past.
</P>
<P>
To this end, he is building on the work of Soviet linguists Sergei Starostin,
Vladislav Marakovic Illic-Svityc and Aaron Dolgopolsky who more than 20 years
ago tediously reconstructed a language spoken 15,000 years ago they call
Nostratic, which means "our language."
</P>
<P>
Shevoroshkin said 1,000 words of Nostratic have been reconstructed by analysis
of common elements from languages he and other scholars believe grew out of the
ancient tongue.
</P>
<P>
Nostratic, they believe, gave rise to the Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic,
Kartvelian, Euralic, Dravidian, Altaic and Eskimo-Aleutian language families.
Hence, making Nostratic a superfamily of languages, or as Shevoroshkin would
put it -- a proto-proto language.
</P>
<P>
His hope is to continue on to the proto-proto-proto stage, if he can find the
clues that will link him to the remote past.
</P>
<P>
Language is unique to the human species, Shevoroshkin said, and one of the
primary characteristics like upright walking and a highly evolved brain that
set humans apart from their cousin primates, the Great Apes.
</P>
<P>
He believes by way of a technique called deep reconstruction, he can tap into
the vocabularies of ancient humans, seeking first those elements that exist in
every language in the world -- first and second person pronouns and names for
parts of the body.
</P>
<P>
Such studies produced one of the startling findings in Nostratic, he said.
</P>
<P>
By studying the word for "eye" in many languages, Soviet researchers were able
to surmise what the word was in Nostratic.
</P>
<P>
"In English, the word is eye. But in German it is auge, very similar. In old
Russian it is oko and in Nostratic we believe it was huka."
</P>
<P>
Words for nature also lend themselves to historic analysis, he said,
emphasizing that because there was no agriculture before 10,000 years ago there
are no words for domesticated animals other than dog.
</P>
<P>
Nostratic scholars have been able to trace that noun among others, he said.
</P>
<P>
But even Shevoroshkin admits this is an arduous task and acknowledges that many
historical linguists doubt he can delve too deeply into the remote past to find
a language before Nostratic.
</P>
<P>
Stanford University linguistic anthropologist Joseph Greenberg, who has
developed a technique called mass comparisons for analyzing various languages,
is one who questions how well Shevoroshkin will do.
</P>
<P>
Greenberg, himself interested in the evolution of the various languages of the
world, prefers not to seek the vocabularies of early humankind but to classify
Earth's myriad tongues past and present.
</P>
<P>
His work produced the classification of African languages in the 1950s, the
groupings generally accepted by linguists today.
</P>
<P>
Greenberg would not call the efforts of Shevoroshkin and his co-investigators
futile but allowed the exercise could prove tedious.
</P>
<P>
"There's enough to show that all human languages have a common origin," said
Greenberg. "I think the really interesting part comes in constructing a family
tree (of languages)."
</P>
<P>
But the problem with family trees, Shevoroshkin said, is that it is easy to
leave out vast groups of languages and never show how one is related to
another.
</P>
<P>
"Linguists divide languages into several families such as Uralic, Indo-European
or Afro-Asiatic, and so on. They usually say they are not related and if they
are there is no proof.
</P>
<P>
"It is our intention to find the proof and to go beyond that," Shevoroshkin
said of his endeavor.
</P>
<P>
"People in this area usually talk about relationships and that makes little
sense to me," offered Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
But linguist Merritt Ruhlen, formerly of Stanford, acknowledged recently in the
journal Science that Shevoroshkin probably is right, that there is an ancient
link tying the world's languages to a common tongue.

TRYING TIME FOR NEW COURTHOUSE;
</P>
<P>
COUNTY, BUILDER BATTLE OVER UNFINISHED VAN NUYS PROJECT
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, Times Staff Writer
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
At its unveiling in mid-October, it was hailed as one of the finest court
buildings in the nation, a gleaming glass-and-granite edifice to justice that
would thrust the San Fernando Valley into the forefront of courthouse design.
</P>
<P>
But the new $52-million Van Nuys Municipal Courthouse may become the subject of
litigation unless a multimillion-dollar dispute between the contractor and Los
Angeles County officials is resolved.
</P>
<P>
Originally, plans had called for Municipal Court personnel to move into the
plush, 11-story, 23-court building, which has its own helipad, 10th-floor
balcony and state-of-the-art security system, in August.
</P>
<P>
But 4 months later, the new building is still occupied by construction workers.
The Municipal Court staff continues to use cramped, makeshift quarters in
bungalows and trailers and on a floor of the Van Nuys Superior Court building
next door.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Locked in Negotiations
</P>
<P>
County officials and Sylmar-based Tutor-Saliba Corp., the contractor, are
locked in negotiations over claims that each side is responsible for the delays
and owes the other millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
The county on Dec. 1 assessed Tutor-Saliba with late penalties of $3 million
for failing to have the building ready by Aug. 15, the completion date
specified in the contract.
</P>
<P>
The penalties will continue to mount at the rate of $28,000 for each day beyond
the completion date, said Thomas V. Schriber, the county's chief manager on the
courthouse project. The total by the end of December was $3.8 million, county
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Such penalties are standard in construction projects and were spelled out in
the 1985 contract between the county and Tutor-Saliba, the low bidder for the
project, Schriber said.
</P>
<P>
The penalties represent the cost to the county of not being able to occupy the
building, he said. For instance, the county must keep inspectors and project
managers at the site, lease space elsewhere and pay other costs because the new
building is not yet open, Schriber said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charges Contested
</P>
<P>
Tutor-Saliba is contesting the extra charges and accuses the county of causing
the delays. Tutor-Saliba has filed a claim seeking $1.7 million from the county
for costs that the company says it has incurred because of the delays.
</P>
<P>
"On numerous occasions over the past 8 months, this office has advised your
firm . . . of our serious concern over your firm's lack of progress on
completing this project," Schriber wrote in a Dec. 1 letter to Tutor-Saliba.
</P>
<P>
Schriber's letter said work was not complete on courthouse communications and
elevator systems, nor on mechanical, fire, safety and electrical systems.
</P>
<P>
It cited the need to replace damaged glass windows, carpets and doors that were
not inspected for fire safety.
</P>
<P>
"To our view, the contractor is not performing as well as we would like," said
Jim Abbott, senior deputy director of the county Facilities Management
Department. "It's fair to say the quality of the work is fine; it's just that
it's taking longer to get the work done than we feel it should have.
</P>
<P>
"Once the courthouse dedication was held," Abbott said, Tutor-Saliba "lost
their concentration on the job."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
President Blames County
</P>
<P>
Ronald N. Tutor, Tutor-Saliba's president, scoffed at the charges and accused
the county of "trying to cover up their own inadequacies" by blaming the
contractor for delays.
</P>
<P>
"That's a bunch of nonsense. The job is being finished up in spite of the
county, not because of it," Tutor said. "The county couldn't build a building
on time if it tried.
</P>
<P>
"They know they don't have a prayer in hell of collecting any part" of the
penalty fees, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tutor said the project has taken longer than scheduled because the county has
repeatedly changed specifications, a charge that Abbott denies. Tutor claims
that the company is entitled to more time to complete the project without late
penalties because the county has required so many changes.
</P>
<P>
The delays are inconveniencing Municipal Court personnel in Van Nuys, said
Aviva K. Bobb, the court's presiding judge.
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned by the 6-month delay in occupying the building. We are
anxious to move in as soon as possible," Bobb said. "The major hardship has
been that the court is spread all over the block. . . . It causes a lot of
delays, inefficiencies."
</P>
<P>
The county has also had to delay plans to renovate the Superior Court building
and to open Juvenile Courts in bungalows now occupied by Municipal courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
The latest tentative plans call for the county to occupy the courthouse in
mid-January and open it to the public in mid-February, said Peggy Shuttleworth,
Valley division chief of the Los Angeles Municipal Court.
</P>
<P>
The building still has to pass inspection by county employees and state fire
marshals, Abbott said. It has failed several preliminary fire inspections in
part because doors were not properly fitted and certified as fire-resistant, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The county is trying to resolve the problems through negotiations with the
company's top management, Abbott said. If negotiations break down, a lawsuit is
one of several options that would be considered, he said.
</P>
<P>
If Tutor-Saliba fails to finish the job, Schriber said, the county would
suspend the firm's contract and have the work done elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The building was formally dedicated Oct. 14 at a ceremony attended by more than
500 people, including county and court officials, politicians and state Supreme
Court Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Graffiti-Resistant Interior
</P>
<P>
The new courthouse features a graffiti-resistant interior; electronic message
boards, similar to those used at ballparks, to provide information on court
services, and a specially designed, high-security courtroom featuring a
bulletproof glass shield to separate spectators from trial participants. The
court's advanced security system features metal detectors, baggage X-ray
machines and closed-circuit cameras in public hallways and high-volume
courtrooms as well as custody areas.
</P>
<P>
The courthouse was funded by the sale of public bonds and by the Robbins
Construction Fund, which adds a penalty assessment to traffic and parking
tickets, said Jerry Orland, head of the project management division of the
Facilities Management Department.
</P>
<P>
It is not the first time that Tutor-Saliba has been accused of foot-dragging on
a county courthouse project. The contractor is building a $19-million Los
Angeles Municipal Courthouse in Cerritos, which is 6 months behind schedule and
has engendered similar charges and countercharges, Orland said.
</P>
<P>
"We're in the same boat there," Orland said.
</P>
<P>
Tutor-Saliba is one of the largest general contractors in California, ranking
70th nationwide in 1987 with $305.3 million in contract awards, according to
Engineering News-Record, a trade publication.
</P>
<P>
Tutor-Saliba was awarded an $18.3-million contract by the state Department of
Transportation to widen a 2-mile stretch of the Ventura Freeway from Valley
Circle Boulevard to White Oak Avenue.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Built Airport Terminal
</P>
<P>
The company built the $125-million Tom Bradley International Terminal at Los
Angeles International Airport and is doing $124 million worth of work on the
Metro Rail subway project in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Many of the items cited in the county's Dec. 1 letter have since been fixed,
but some problems remain, officials said.
</P>
<P>
On a recent tour of the courthouse, county inspectors pointed out such defects
as seams and discolorations on carpets, scratches on glass windows and walls
that needed touch-up paint. Other problems included double doors that must be
replaced because they were too narrow to lock and wheelchair lifts that failed
to function during a recent inspection.
</P>
<P>
"At this point, a lot of the changes are just cosmetic stuff and 98% of the
work is already done," said Mike McNeil, county building inspector. "But when
you're talking about a $52-million building, that 2% adds up to a lot of little
things left to be done."

GETTING TO KNOW HIM;
</P>
<P>
FAMILIARITY WITH CURTIS R. TUCKER JR. MAY BE IN NAME ONLY
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who is Curtis R. Tucker Jr.?
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, he was a little-known legislative aide whose father -- Curtis
R. Tucker, the feisty political patriarch of Inglewood -- was on his way to an
eighth term as assemblyman from the 50th District.
</P>
<P>
Today, the younger Tucker is considered the heavy favorite in a special
election to replace his father, who died of cancer in October. One of the
state's most powerful politicians, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San
Francisco), has made it clear that he intends to use his financial and
political muscle to get Tucker elected. Brown even persuaded Gov. George
Deukmejian to move up the election from April 11 to Feb. 7, shortening the time
that other candidates have to raise money and campaign.
</P>
<P>
Brown's heavy support for Tucker appears to have discouraged several other
potentially strong candidates from entering the race. The four candidates who
decided to run against Tucker are considered unlikely to raise enough money to
compete with Brown's resources.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little-Known Candidate
</P>
<P>
In interviews, many elected officials and others in Inglewood -- the political
heart of the district -- say they know little about Tucker. The other
candidates in the race plan to exploit the voters' lack of familiarity with
Tucker.
</P>
<P>
"Why hasn't he made himself known?" asks candidate Rod Wright, a veteran
political consultant. "You don't say, 'My father did this and this, so vote for
me.' That's not the way it works in America."
</P>
<P>
Tucker acknowledges that he has kept a low profile in the district. While his
brother-in-law, John Gibbs, served as the assemblyman's legislative aide in the
50th District, Tucker worked five years as an aide to mid-Wilshire Assemblyman
Mike Roos, the Assembly speaker pro tem, before going to work for Assemblywoman
Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) in the neighboring 49th District eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't spent as much time in the (50th) district as I would have liked,"
Tucker said. "But I am known in the district. I know the players."
</P>
<P>
The heir apparent is 34, a tall, husky, bearded man with glasses. In an
interview last week, he seemed comfortable with his new role in the limelight.
He talked freely about the issue that may dominate the abbreviated campaign:
himself.
</P>
<P>
"If they spend all their time making me an issue, fine," he said. "I'll be
talking about the real issues: health, crime, airport noise."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Brown's Puppet
</P>
<P>
Of his critics and rival candidates -- who dismiss him as a puppet of Brown
whose only credential is his name -- Tucker said:
</P>
<P>
"They're discounting what I've done for the past six years, who I know, and how
the real world works. It's sour grapes."
</P>
<P>
Asserting that most people in politics have a mentor, he added: "They have to
realize the nature of politics and remember how they got where they are."
</P>
<P>
Rival candidate Lois Hill-Hale, an Inglewood school board member and former
aide to state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), said voters will resent
Brown's "big boss" tactics. She said she has never encountered Tucker during 10
years of political work in Sacramento and in the 50th District. She said many
voters do not know that the elder Tucker has died, and she predicted that her
opponent would exploit that confusion.
</P>
<P>
"I think he's going to keep as low a profile as possible and hope that as many
as people as possible will not find out that his father has passed," she said.
</P>
<P>
Tucker responded: "A lot of people have told me, don't use 'junior' on your
name, don't change the color of your father's campaign signs, don't use your
picture on literature. But I'm not trying to fool anybody. I'll always be
junior."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Follow Father's Agenda
</P>
<P>
Tucker promises to carry on his father's policies, particularly the careful
attention to constituents that was the foundation of the assemblyman's
strength, along with big war chests financed by the health industry and labor.
Tucker says his legislative office will provide "one-stop" service for
constituents who need help. He says his differences with his father are largely
a matter of style, though he considers himself slightly more conservative on
issues such as crime.
</P>
<P>
"He favored capital punishment, but I'd be more likely to use it," he said. "I
believe it's a deterrent, and I believe it's cheaper to throw the switch than
to pay to keep someone in jail."
</P>
<P>
Tucker's upbringing was steeped in politics. His family was known as "the
Tucker army" because of their involvement in the career of their father, who
was appointed Inglewood's first black councilman in 1972, was elected to the
Assembly two years later and eventually became Health Committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
As the third of five children and the only son of a "very strong" father,
Tucker says he was restless and resisted his father's pressure to follow a
rapid career path. Instead, he attended several colleges, finally earning a
bachelor's degree in history from Cal State Dominguez Hills in 1980. He also
worked in construction for Pacific Telephone.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to see what was out there," Tucker said. "I liked climbing poles and
filling manholes. It gave me a different perspective on life. My father didn't
like it, but he knew I'd eventually get tired of getting wet and dirty."
</P>
<P>
Tucker, who is married and has two children, entered politics in 1983 as a
legislative assistant based in Roos' 46th District field office. He acted as a
liaison with community groups on several projects, according to people who
worked with him, including a 1986 bill (AB 2700) to toughen penalties on
apartment owners who did not cooperate with police against drug-dealing
tenants. He also worked on preparing a 1987 bill (AB 1700) that provided
incentives to the Los Angeles Unified School District to build multistory
school buildings rather than tear down neighboring homes.
</P>
<P>
"It gives the school board money to build more creatively on less land," Tucker
said. "It suppresses the need of cutting further into housing stock."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Praised Effort
</P>
<P>
A legislative staffer who knows Tucker's work praised his efforts on that bill.
"The school district was happy and the homeowners were happy," the staffer
said. "I'd give Curtis an 'A' on that one."
</P>
<P>
The staffer described Tucker as intelligent and capable. But Tucker's work
sometimes suffered because of absenteeism and a seeming lack of motivation, the
staffer said: "There was some concern about the quality of his work. . . . I
think he has the chance to be an above-average assembly member. He has the
intellect. The question is, does he have the drive, the fire in the belly?"
</P>
<P>
Tucker responded: "I would say that's one person's opinion. Everyone is not
going to thrilled with your performance. That goes without saying."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, George Allen, executive director of the Wilshire Chamber of
Commerce on which Tucker served as Roos' representative, had nothing but
praise.
</P>
<P>
"He's an outstanding young man and a hard worker," Allen said. "I highly
recommend him."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Positioning for Future
</P>
<P>
Whatever Tucker's early doubts about a future in politics, he said his move
this year to Assemblywoman Moore's office was calculated to bring him closer to
the 50th District and position him for the future.
</P>
<P>
Asked why his father did not hire him as an aide, Tucker said they both
believed it was better they did not work in the same office for both political
and personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
"The press would have had a field day with it," he said. "One family member
shouldn't work directly for another."
</P>
<P>
But the family had a synchronized political agenda, Tucker said. Having turned
70, Assemblyman Tucker intended his 1988-90 term to be his last; in 1990, the
plan was for Curtis Jr. to take center stage.
</P>
<P>
"My father always wanted to be mayor of Inglewood," Tucker said. "He would have
run for mayor, and I would have run for Assembly in 1990."
</P>
<P>
But the elder Tucker's death has "speeded up the process tremendously," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Tucker's sudden emergence appears to have frustrated the ambitions of potential
rivals, such as Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent and Councilman Daniel Tabor,
both of whom have carefully built their careers toward a run for the Assembly.
Both have said Tucker is not entitled to the seat simply because of his name.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Has He Paid His Dues?'
</P>
<P>
"The opportunity to select among a qualified field of candidates has been
eliminated," Tabor said. Alluding to the predominantly black voter base in the
district, he added: "The real question is, how well does the African-American
community manage the process of preparing leaders for the future? You tell
people to go out and pay dues. Has he paid his dues?"
</P>
<P>
Tucker says he has.
</P>
<P>
"There is no prerequisite course for being a member of the Assembly," he said.
"There should be a need to serve and a desire to do a good job."
</P>
<P>
Tucker hopes to win election Feb. 7 by capturing more than 50% of the vote,
thus avoiding an April 11 runoff against Mike Davis, the only Republican
running. Tucker says his campaign plans to spend between $100,000 and $150,000
on the race and will use an adviser from Brown's Sacramento operation, as well
as political consultant Parke Skelton, who ran the elder Tucker's last
campaign.
</P>
<P>
If elected, Tucker said he will follow his father's lead in giving special
attention to health matters; he hopes to work on a comprehensive package of
health-care legislation being prepared by Brown that will be named after the
elder Tucker. He also said that although his father had a mild aversion to
publicity, especially television, he plans to have a higher profile and use the
media to report on what he is doing in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
Tucker's opponents look forward to confronting him on equal footing at debates
scheduled for next month. They say Tucker's advantage will crumble when voters
compare the candidates in person.
</P>
<P>
But Frank Lewis, an Inglewood dentist and longtime Tucker ally, said Tucker
will live up to his father's legacy.
</P>
<P>
"He's quiet," Lewis said. "But he knows politics. He's well-versed. People are
going to be surprised."
</P>
<P>
Tucker said: "So many people who go into politics have a puffed up sense of
self-worth. My father never took himself seriously. . . . And I'm still the
same person who hung off telephone poles. I have no illusions about who I am."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TUCKER ON RECORD
</P>
<P>
"I haven't spent as much time in the (50th) district as I would have liked, but
I am known in the district. I know the players."
</P>
<P>
"(My critics) are discounting what I've done for the past six years, who I
know, and how the real world works. It's sour grapes."
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have told me, don't use 'junior' on your name, don't change
the color of your father's campaign signs, don't use your picture on
literature. But I'm not trying to fool anybody. I'll always be junior."
</P>
<P>
"(My father) favored capital punishment, but I'd be more likely to use it. I
believe it's a deterrent, and I believe it's cheaper to throw the switch than
to pay to keep someone in jail."
</P>
<P>
"My father always wanted to be mayor of Inglewood. He would have run for mayor,
and I would have run for Assembly in 1990. (But the elder Tucker's death has
"speeded up the process tremendously."

ARCHDIOCESE SEEKS WOMAN'S EVICTION;
</P>
<P>
CHURCH WANTS TO USE HOME WHERE 20-YEAR TENANT HAS LIVED RENT-FREE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles say they have been
patient with Antonia Martin, but their patience has run out.
</P>
<P>
They want the 59-year-old Torrance woman to pack her bags and leave the
church-owned Torrance house where she has lived for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Martin says she can't afford to move.
</P>
<P>
So on Jan. 11, the archdiocese will ask a South Bay Municipal Court judge to
evict her.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paid No Rent
</P>
<P>
The 600-square-foot wood-frame house at 20535 Anza Blvd. is on the grounds of
St. James Catholic School, where Antonia's late husband, Angel, was a custodian
from 1968 until his death in July of 1987. The church allowed the couple and
their two daughters to live there rent-free while he worked at the school.
</P>
<P>
Now that he is gone, the church wants Antonia Martin out of the house so it can
be used for school faculty meetings.
</P>
<P>
Martin, who lives alone, contends that a priest at St. James Catholic Church in
Redondo Beach, which runs the school, told her in November that she could stay
until she could afford to move. Now, she said, church officials have gone back
on their word.
</P>
<P>
"I thought that the church would be more sensitive toward me," said Martin, who
came with her husband to the South Bay from Cuba in 1967. "I thought they would
be more considerate."
</P>
<P>
Martin, who said she has a back ailment that prevents her from working, lives
on $340-a-month disability checks. She said she can't find a suitable apartment
that she can afford.
</P>
<P>
"I would move if I could afford it," she said. "I just can't do it."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stay Until June
</P>
<P>
Martin said she only wants to stay in the home until June, when she turns 60
and becomes eligible for Social Security benefits. She said she does not know
how much the payments will be, but she hopes the money will enable her to
afford an apartment.
</P>
<P>
Neal Blaney director of real estate for the archdiocese, said that if the
priest -- who is on vacation and could not be reached -- did promise to let
Martin stay, he did not mean she could stay until June, nearly two years after
her husband's death.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to give this house to her rent-free forever," he said.
"Months have gone by, and we have had no indication that she has found or
intends to find other housing."
</P>
<P>
The church referred Martin to the Catholic Charities social service agency in
Long Beach, but Lupe Macker the regional director, said Martin has "not been
very cooperative."
</P>
<P>
Macker said Martin was offered several housing options, including group housing
for the elderly and care and board facilities, but none appealed to her.
</P>
<P>
"She has not accepted the reality that she has to move," Macker said.
</P>
<P>
Martin said she wants to stay in the Torrance area and the housing offered by
the agency was too far away or had other drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
Mark Todd, a paralegal working for the archdiocese, said the church has offered
to allow Martin to stay in the home rent-free until Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
"But that is our final offer," he said. "I think the church has been very
lenient. There is no doubt about it."
</P>
<P>
Margaret Kirby, a Hermosa Beach attorney who has taken Martin's case, says
Martin should be allowed to stay in the house until June because church
officials told Martin "to take all the time you need."
</P>
<P>
"Besides," Kirby said, "if the school has been without a meeting place for 20
years, why can't they wait a few more months?"
</P>
<P>
Kirby said Martin cannot find other housing because of her limited income.
</P>
<P>
"You try to find an apartment for $340 a month and see how you do," she said.
Martin has applied to several retirement homes, but they were too expensive or
had long waiting lists, she said.
</P>
<P>
Martin said she does not want to seek help or move in with one of her two grown
daughters, one in Lomita and one in Cerritos, because "they have their own
lives, and I don't want to burden them."
</P>
<P>
Both church officials and Martin said they are willing to negotiate. But if
negotiations fail and the case goes to court, Martin said, "I just hope God's
grace is with me."

FLORA OF THE VALLEY: COCKLEBURS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cockleburs, a common plant in fields and riverbeds, along roadsides and near
reservoirs, is easily recognized by its prickly burs.
</P>
<P>
With numerous species, cockleburs are plentiful throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
The most frequently seen in California are Xanthium strumarium and Xanthium
spinosum. Xanthium is a Greek word meaning yellow and was the ancient name of a
plant used to dye hair.
</P>
<P>
 Although their origin is unknown, cockleburs are not considered native plants.
Often pesky, they can develop solid stands on river flood plains covering many
acres.
</P>
<P>
Because each bur-like fruit contains two seeds that produces its own generation
of offspring, cockleburs are difficult to eradicate once started. One of the
seeds requires much more oxygen than the other and remains dormant for a year
longer than its twin. Seeds are protected by airtight coats.
</P>
<P>
Cockleburs are bushy plants that grow to about 3 feet tall. Their inconspicuous
flowers are greenish and minute.
</P>
<P>
The hairy, egg-shaped burs are about half-an-inch long and covered with hooked
prickles that attach themselves to animal fur, manes and tails.
</P>
<P>
The stems are covered with tiny hairs. The oval to wedge-shaped leaves are
toothed and 2 to 5 inches long. They are thick in texture and usually are
three-lobed.
</P>
<P>
Cockleburs in the seedling stage are poisonous to animals. MAYERENE BARKER

<P>
Shawn James Schultz, while playing a game of "chicken" with friends about 11
p.m., laid down and placed his head on the tracks at Oceanside Boulevard,
between Cleveland and Myers streets, Sgt. Reggie Grigsby said.

JIM MURRAY: 1988: IT WAS VINTAGE YEAR FOR LOSERS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hello 1989, I thought you'd never get here.
</P>
<P>
1988? I thought you'd never leave.
</P>
<P>
In a way, it was the Year of the Loser. In order, they were:
</P>
<P>
1. Ben Johnson -- Oh, rare, Ben Johnson. How can anyone lose more devastatingly
than at the very hour of achieving his life's ambition? When it all falls to
ashes just after all one's dreams are realized, when the world is at his feet,
when what you have worked for, strived for, dreamed of all your life has just
come true -- and someone comes in and tells you it's all been a mistake. Ben
had just won the Olympic gold medal, set the world record and identified
himself as the greatest sprinter of all time when suddenly a man in a white lab
coat turns it to nightmare. When they stripped Jim Thorpe of his medals, he
became an object of pity. Ben Johnson became an object of scorn. He lost more
than a medal. He lost respect. Ben makes loser-of-the-year unanimously.
</P>
<P>
2. Dave Stieb -- Would you classify as a loser a pitcher who lost a no-hitter
with two-out in the bottom on the ninth to a bad-hop single through the
infield? OK, how about a pitcher who lost two no-hitters in a row that way?
That, my friends, is major-league losing. Just a twist here and you're looking
at the second guy in major-league history to pitch back-to-back no- hitters.
You are looking at Johnny Vander Meer II. You are looking at a guy who will
become the answer to a trivia question through 2000 A.D. Alas! The ball hopped.
</P>
<P>
3. Pat Dye -- How do you become a loser-of-the-year when you have the ball on
your opponents' 13-yard line, 3 points behind, with 4 seconds left to play?
Right! You kick a field goal. A losers' play. You go for the tie. You strike
your colors, fold your hand, cry uncle. It's what Auburn coach Pat Dye did in
last year's Sugar Bowl against Syracuse. Whatever happened to "Winning isn't
everything, it's the only thing?" Whatever became of Fight, fight, fight?
Stonewall Jackson would never understand. Neither would George Gipp. Woody
Hayes would hit somebody.
</P>
<P>
4. Davey Johnson -- How would you like to be in Game 7 of the playoff series
for the National League pennant and have a pitcher on your staff who is known
as "Dr.K," who has struck out more than 1,000 batters, won 18 games in the
season and is only 23 years old. He is on the bench with 3 days rest. The
opposition is starting its best pitcher who has had only 3 days rest and has
already pitched 3 times in the series. Nevertheless, Manager Davey Johnson
doesn't start Dwight Gooden in the most important game of the season. The Mets
manager starts Ron Darling with predictable results. He doesn't save Gooden
anyway. Dwight gets in the game with the score 6-0 and the pennant gone. In the
other dugout, Manager Tom Lasorda plays the ace -- Orel Hershiser. Davey
Johnson makes loser-of-the-year by acclamation, the pinup boy for every
second-guesser east of the Tehachapis.
</P>
<P>
5. Dennis Eckersley -- How would you like to be the best relief pitcher in the
American League with a league-leading 45 saves, an ERA of 2.35, a record of
having only walked 11 batsmen all year and a record of having finished 53 of
the 60 games you appeared -- and in the ninth inning of the first World Series
game, you are breezing along with a 4-3 lead and have just retired the first
two batters to face you, one by strikeout, the other by weak grounder. You need
an out to, maybe, just clinch the whole World Series when up comes this batter
who has hit just .196 all year with no great reputation for power (he has hit 2
home runs and has 17 runs-batted-in). He strikes out a lot (once every 4 1/2
times at-bat).
</P>
<P>
This is not Babe Ruth but you, you, unaccountably, begin to pitch to him as if
he were. The next thing you know, you have just walked Mike Davis and put the
tying run on first base. But, never mind. Get a load of the guy who's coming up
to pinch-hit. He looks like a guy leaving a train wreck. He can hardly walk. He
winces just lifting the bat. He's only going to tap the ball into play some
place and hope for a big break. This is the only at-bat he'll get in the whole
Series and he doesn't look as if he can handle even this. You get two quick
strikes on this refugee from the disabled list and this looks like a mismatch.
The chances are good he couldn't get around on a medium-good fastball if you
sent it up there with stamps on it. So, for some reasons best known to the
gremlins of baseball, you decide to try what you call a "backdoor slider" on
him. Now, the slider is the pitch the late Fresco Thompson used to say was
going to put * lot of .270 hitters in the Hall of Fame. It was, he said, the
pitch that let Maris break Babe Ruth's home-run record.
</P>
<P>
It has been variously described as the "nickel curve," the "downtown pitch,"
and, when it doesn't work, as "the slop slider." This one you let go of is all
three. At the bat, Kirk Gibson can't believe his good luck. His eyes get big,
his groin doesn't hurt any more. He dreams of pitches like this. As Joe
Garagiola would say, "you couldn't order a better one from room service."
Gibson swings. Not hard, just about like a guy lofting a 9-iron to a trapped
green. It is out of the lot the minute it leaves the bat. It is one of the
historic home runs of baseball history. It wins, to all intents and purposes,
the World Series. It is a pitch Dennis Eckersley probably wanted to run after
and retrieve the minute he let go of it. To call time. Pray for an earthquake.
Anything to get that ball back in his glove before it goes into the right-field
seats.
</P>
<P>
That pitch is one of the great losers of 1988. It is a game-loser and a
Series-loser. They don't get any worse than that.

CHICAGO ROLLS PAST PHILADELPHIA AS FOG BLANKETS SOLDIER FIELD
</P>

CHICAGO
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You just couldn't see the Chicago Bears beating the Philadelphia Eagles
Saturday in their National Football Conference semifinal playoff game.
</P>
<P>
Oh, the Bears won, 20-12. You just couldn't see it.
</P>
<P>
Or much of anything else on a day when fog, rolling in off Lake Michigan,
severely hampered visibility at Soldier Field. Veterans in the press box said
it was the worst they'd seen, or rather not seen, at this stadium in half a
century.
</P>
<P>
Who knows? When they review the film, they may yet discover Philadelphia won.
</P>
<P>
Mike Ditka vs. Buddy Ryan? This was more like Sherlock Holmes vs. Professor
Moriarty.
</P>
<P>
But in the end, as is often the case at Soldier Field, blue sky or no sky, the
game came down to the Bear defensive unit. Ranked No. 2 in the National
Football League, it lived up to its ranking, intercepting 3 Randall Cunningham
passes and holding the Eagles to 52 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
And the Eagles helped out by constantly breaking down offensively. Penalties,
dropped passes, missed opportunities -- Philadelphia was guilty of all that as
it failed to reach the end zone despite the fact that Cunningham completed 27
of 54 passes for 407 yards.
</P>
<P>
At times, the players couldn't even see the end zone.
</P>
<P>
"What I could see was about 20 yards downfield," Cunningham said. "If you take
your 10-yard dropback, you could see only about 15 yards.
</P>
<P>
"We had to change to our short routes. They knew that. But let me say first, we
beat ourselves."
</P>
<P>
And much to the delight of the crowd of 65,534. Or at least that portion of the
crowd that could see what was going on. Pity the poor fan who shelled out $30
to sit in a seat and watch the blurry figures fade in and out of the mist. Kind
of like paying for a big fight to be beamed into your living room only to have
the picture go out on your television set.
</P>
<P>
In the press box, the media were reduced to listening to reports from the field
or watching monitors.
</P>
<P>
How often do you hear the public address announcer say, "There's word of a flag
on the field."
</P>
<P>
Never mind instant replay. Saturday's game may begin a debate over the use of
radar.
</P>
<P>
It was a great day for getting away with holding, 12 men on the field or the
hidden-ball trick.
</P>
<P>
It would have been a great afternoon for legendary Bear runner Red Grange,
known as the Galloping Ghost.
</P>
<P>
So much for the home-field advantage. The fans can't cheer for what they can
only hear.
</P>
<P>
Strangely enough, the day began with a bright blue sky and the temperature in
the 30s.
</P>
<P>
It was under those conditions that the Bears took an early lead.
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Mike Tomczak, starting his first NFL playoff game, made his first
completion a memorable one, connecting with Dennis McKinnon on a 64-yard
touchdown pass play in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
"There was a problem with the coverage, and I think we might have had the right
play called," Tomczak said. (Receiver Glen) Kozlowski cut underneath, and I
think the corner (Roynell Young) was starting to move inside, apparently
thinking Dennis was also going inside. Dennis just headed upfield and had the
corner beat. It was a great fake on Dennis' part."
</P>
<P>
It also helped that safety Andre Waters, the only man with a shot at McKinnon,
fell down.
</P>
<P>
He got up after McKinnon had caught the ball at the Philadelphia 40 and had a
shot at the Bear receiver but missed the tackle, leaving McKinnon to celebrate
the last 15 yards.
</P>
<P>
In all, Tomczak completed 10 of 20 for 172 yards before he was forced out in
the third quarter on a play in which he had his third interception, this one to
Terry Hoage.
</P>
<P>
Reggie White hit Tomczak, reinjuring the left shoulder that Tomczak had
separated several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Jim McMahon, originally forced to the sideline with a twisted knee and then
kept there by Tomczak's success as a starter, finished the game.
</P>
<P>
Ditka, the Bear coach, said he would wait to see how severe Tomczak's injury is
before naming a starter for next week's NFC championship game, where the Bears
will play host to the winner of today's Minnesota Vikings-San Francisco 49ers
game.
</P>
<P>
After giving up the bomb to McKinnon, the Eagles responded with their own
aerial attack.
</P>
<P>
Remember, the sun was still out at this point, and the end zone was clearly in
sight.
</P>
<P>
But beyond reach.
</P>
<P>
On their first drive after the touchdown, the Eagles wound up with nothing when
Luis Zendejas missed a 43-yard field-goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia got the ball back on the first play of the Bears' next drive on
Seth Joyner's interception.
</P>
<P>
Then came one of the Eagles' most frustrating drives of the season, exceeded
only by its next drive.
</P>
<P>
More about that later.
</P>
<P>
Taking over at the Chicago 30, Philadelphia drove to the 9, where Cunningham
hit Cris Carter with a pass in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
The apparent touchdown was called back because of illegal motion by running
back Anthony Toney.
</P>
<P>
So Cunningham came right back and fired it into the end zone again. This time,
4 men touched the ball. Defenders Dave Duerson and Mike Richardson got a hand
on it. Carter also got a piece, batting the ball into the arms of fellow
receiver Mike Quick.
</P>
<P>
Touchdown at last?
</P>
<P>
Not quite. Again a penalty. Again Toney. This time holding.
</P>
<P>
So the Eagles settled for Zendejas' 42-yard field goal. In all, he would kick
4, the others coming from 29, 30 and 35 yards.
</P>
<P>
The Eagles' frustration, however, was just beginning.
</P>
<P>
On their next drive, they reached the Chicago 4, where they faced a fourth and
1.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham kept the ball on a draw and was hit at the line by Dante Jones.
</P>
<P>
The officials brought out the chains. And measured. And checked. And checked
again.
</P>
<P>
The verdict?
</P>
<P>
Short by an inch.
</P>
<P>
On their next drive, the Eagles again apparently had a touchdown in their
grasp. Keith Jackson was wide open in the end zone, but he jumped too soon for
Cunningham's perfect pass and dropped it.
</P>
<P>
Chicago took the ensuing kickoff and drove to another touchdown, Neal Anderson
going in from the Eagle 4 off left tackle.
</P>
<P>
By now the fog rolled in, and the Eagles were ready to roll out of postseason
play.
</P>
<P>
The Bears added 6 points on Kevin Butler's field goals of 46 and 27 yards.
</P>
<P>
When it was over, Eagle Coach Buddy Ryan, a former assistant at Chicago, where
he had a long-running feud with Ditka, was asked if he had shaken hands with
his former head coach.
</P>
<P>
"What," he asked, "was there to shake about?"
</P>
<P>
NFC Playoff Notes
</P>
<P>
The Chicago interceptions were by Mickey Pruitt, Vestee Jackson and Maurice
Douglass. . . . Keith Jackson, despite his drop, had a big day receiving with 7
catches for 142 yards. Running back Keith Byars made 9 catches for 103 yards.
Byars was Philadelphia's leading ballcarrier with 34 yards in 7 carries. . . .
Thomas Sanders led Chicago with 94 yards rushing, 58 coming on a second-quarter
run.

COURTNALL TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO OFFENSE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES H. JACKSON, The Baltimore Sun
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prior to this season, Geoff Courtnall, the Washington Capitals' hard-hitting,
high-scoring left wing was mainly used as a checker and a guy who would give up
his body to go into the boards and create havoc with opposing players. If he
scored, all well and good, but his main job was disturbing the other team's
attack.
</P>
<P>
This year all of that has changed and Courtnall is the leading scorer on the
Capitals and one of the driving offensive forces in the team's surge for first
place in the Patrick Division of the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
"My job in the past was to go after the other guy," said Courtnall, who has 19
goals and 19 assists entering Tuesday night's game at the Capital Centre at
Landover, Md., against the Philadelphia Flyers. "My concern was not scoring,
but stirring things up. I like it much better this year. I like being involved
in the scoring. I always had a good shot and I always believed I could score,
but that wasn't my primary role. I did what I was supposed to do."
</P>
<P>
In his previous five seasons with the Boston Bruins, Courtnall, 6-feet-1,
195-pound, a native of Victoria, British Columbia, scored 82 goals and handed
out 85 assists in 271 games. Last season, one which he split between Boston and
Edmonton, was his best scoring year with 36 goals and 30 assists. Barring
serious injury, he should easily surpass both figures this season.
</P>
<P>
The Capitals acquired Courtnall, 26, from Edmonton for Greg Adams last July.
</P>
<P>
"Geoff Courtnall has added a new dimension to our power play and has been our
most consistent scorer," said Capitals Coach Bryan Murray. "He is a very aware
hockey player. He sees so much of the ice. Not only is he a very adept passer,
but he has a tremendous shot. He really has a gun as he has demonstrated on
many occasions this season. He has been a very welcome addition to our hockey
club."
</P>
<P>
Courtnall, whose twin brother Russ plays for the Montreal Canadiens, leads the
Capitals in home scoring with 12 goals and 10 assists and had the second
longest scoring streak in team history when he scored in 15 consecutive games
earlier this season. He leads the team in shots with 120 and collected his
200th National Hockey League point Dec. 7 against the New Jersey Devils. He
also has nine power-play goals.
</P>
<P>
Murray, in his eighth season with Washington, achieved his 300th NHL coaching
victory Dec. 15. He has coached 581 games and is tied with Tommy Ivan for 16th
on the all-time victory list. Ivan coached Detroit and Chicago from 1947 until
1958.
</P>
<P>
Voting for the teams that will compete in the 40th NHL All-Star game Feb. 7 in
Edmonton, Alberta, will end Sunday. Voting began in November.
</P>
<P>
The Wales conference All-Stars will be coached by Terry O'Reilly of the Boston
Bruins and the Campbell conference team will be coached by Glen Sather of the
Edmonton Oilers. Norm Ullman and Bruce MacGregor, both former NHL players, have
been named honorary captains for the game.
</P>
<P>
Hartford wing Sylvain Turgeon underwent surgery on a separated left shoulder
Thursday and will be sidelined for three months. The Whalers recalled Dallas
Gaume from Binghamton of the American Hockey League to replace him.
</P>
<P>
Where are they now? Reggie Leach, who scored the most goals in a season (61 in
1976) for the Philadelphia Flyers and played 13 seasons with the Flyers,
Boston, California and Detroit. He won the Conn Smythe Trophy in 1976 when the
Flyers won the Stanley Cup by beating Montreal, 4-0. He scored 666 points in
934 games, including 381 goals. Leach owns Sports Lawn Service in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
Hockey fans in Pittsburgh have missed Wayne Gretzky two years in a row. Last
season, when he was with Edmonton, he missed the Oilers' only game in
Pittsburgh because of an injury, and this season he missed the Kings' only game
in Pittsburgh because of his grandmother's funeral. Gretzky said that his
grandmother, Mary Gretzky, used to sit in a chair and play goalie for him when
he practiced his shooting.
</P>
<P>
Petr Klima of the Detroit Red Wings has been going through some highs and lows
lately. Last week, he went to the airport to meet his parents, Josef and Kveta
Klima, for a reunion. He had not seen them since he defected from
Czechoslovakia in August 1985. The next day, he was in court, pleading guilty
to a drunken driving charge and leaving an accident scene. It was his second
conviction.

SPORTS COLD WAR IS BEGINNING TO THAW
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GERGEN, Newsday
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consider it a positive development in international relations that the Soviets
have become frequent tourists. Familiarity has diluted contempt. Alas, it also
has dulled the expectations of such meetings.
</P>
<P>
When Mikhail Gorbachev stepped out of a limousine to shake hands with U.S.
citizens during his recent visit, he followed the inclination of his nation's
athletes. For more than a decade, they have enjoyed North American hospitality
in increasing numbers. Until the advent of glasnost, they just lacked the
freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
Now there is as much interest, if not more, in what they say as in the way they
play. When the Central Red Army team meets the New York Islanders at Nassau
Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y., Thursday night, the focus will be on defenseman
Vyatcheslav Fetisov, not only because he may be the best in the world at what
he does, but also because he has made public his frustration in being prevented
from joining the New Jersey Devils. "If it weren't for Gorbachev," he said
Wednesday, "this (discussion) would be impossible."
</P>
<P>
But the sports exchanges between East and West preceded the improved dialogue
between government officials. This marks the seventh tour of NHL rinks by one
or more Soviet clubs in the last 13 years, and that doesn't include such
special events as the Challenge Cup, the Canada Cup or the Rendez-Vous '87
series. And hockey is merely the tip of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
This year, Soviet teams have competed in basketball, volleyball, boxing,
wrestling and, yes, even baseball on U.S. soil. The U.S.S.R. has sent us
wrestlers and weightlifters, among others, in the past. A decade ago, it even
entered a team in World Team Tennis. The team wasn't very good, but it was the
only one in the league that managed to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
And now we have in our midst the Red Army team and Dynamo Riga team, which
played the second game on a western swing Wednesday night in Edmonton, Alberta.
The NHL is billing it as a Super Series, but it's more superfluous than
anything. We have passed the point where either side has much to prove in terms
of superiority.
</P>
<P>
That wasn't the case in 1972, of course. The Soviets were regarded as amateurs
(in the most derisive sense of the word) by the Canadian hockey establishment
when the NHL agreed to make available its seasoned pros in an eight-game hockey
summit.
</P>
<P>
Officials laughed at the Soviets' equipment before the first game at the
Montreal Forum, and at least one newspaper columnist promised to eat his words
if Team Canada lost as much as one game.
</P>
<P>
"It was our first training camp," Islanders President Bill Torrey recalled
Wednesday. "We watched the game at the beautiful Holiday Inn in Peterborough
(Ontario). We went up 2-0 and everyone was saying this is going to be a piece
of cake."
</P>
<P>
But the Soviets stormed back to win the first game in a rout, and the NHL's
best didn't clinch a 4-3-1 series victory until the final minute of the final
game, played in Moscow. "That was my last year of midgets," said Bryan
Trottier, then a 16-year-old in rural Saskatchewan. "I remember the last game
was on at 11 o'clock. The whole school shut down and we all went to the
auditorium to watch it on television."
</P>
<P>
The drama, intensified by the belief that the teams were upholding a way of
life, was riveting. And the lack of previous contact between the groups led to
suspicion. There was the story of Wayne Cashman, who, convinced his hotel room
in Moscow was bugged, located a foreign-looking object underneath the carpet
and proceeded to unscrew it, sending a chandelier in the room below toppling to
the floor.
</P>
<P>
From a sporting standpoint, the cold war between East and West ended on the ice
in Moscow. The World Hockey Association sent a team of all-stars to Moscow two
years later and, in 1976, the Soviets sent two club teams to tour North
America.
</P>
<P>
On the evening before the Red Army made its initial appearance at the Coliseum
almost 13 years ago, Islanders owner Roy Boe hosted a reception for the
visitors. "If you want plenty of beer or vodka," he said, "we'll do what we can
to help."
</P>
<P>
North American teams have since gone beyond providing alcohol for the visitors.
Last summer, the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association
worked to rehabilitate the Achilles injury that had sidelined Soviet center
Arvidas Sabonis. He returned from the injury in time to lead his country to an
upset of the U.S. team in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Such consideration didn't make everyone in the United States happy. John
Thompson, for one, was critical of Americans giving aid to the enemy even
before the team he coached was ambushed in Seoul, South Korea. But, as the
Trail Blazers explained, they were only protecting their own investment. They
had drafted Sabonis and were hopeful that he would be permitted to wear a
Portland uniform after the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
They're still waiting, as are the Devils for Fetisov. Many on both sides
believe it's inevitable that individual Soviet athletes will be permitted to
play for professional teams in North America, further blurring the distinctions
in lifestyle that once gave such bite to games between the East and West.
</P>
<P>
"In the actual situation of world extension, of the relationship between our
countries," Soviet forward Igor Larionov said Wednesday through an interpreter,
"it's a good step." Larionov has been drafted by the Vancouver Canucks. Is he
interested in playing here? "Why not?" he replied, smiling.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps some day there will be Soviets sprinkled throughout the NHL, the NBA
and other professional leagues. And perhaps at such a time the presence of even
the leader of the U.S.S.R. won't halt traffic in New York.

DYNAMO RIGA PROVES TOO MUCH FOR KINGS, 'COACH' MCNALL, 5-3
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Owner Bruce McNall was behind the Kings' bench for the game against the Soviet
team Saturday night, wearing a sweater proclaiming him, "Coach."
</P>
<P>
Of course, when they presented him with the chance to coach the team in this
exhibition game, they expected it to be a pleasant experience. The Kings were
supposed to beat Dynamo Riga.
</P>
<P>
The big surprise was that Dynamo Riga defeated the Kings, 5-3, before a crowd
of 11,490 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
"The coaches wanted me to see what it was like behind the bench," McNall said.
"I found out that it's confusing. It's upsetting. I don't know how they do it.
. . . It was interesting. But I guess I did something wrong. Anyway, they told
me that's the last time I coach.
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty humiliating for me to be canned after my coaching debut."
</P>
<P>
It was pretty humiliating for the Kings to lose to Dynamo Riga, a young team
that was playing its fourth game in 5 days after traveling from Calgary to
Edmonton to Vancouver to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Dynamo Riga, the weaker of the two Soviet teams making a tour of the National
Hockey League, had been losing ground with every game. The visitors opened with
a 2-2 tie at Calgary, lost at Edmonton, 2-1, then lost at Vancouver, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
But against the Kings, they jumped out to a 5-1 lead before Wayne McBean and
Wayne Gretzky narrowed the gap with third-period goals.
</P>
<P>
Coach Robbie Ftorek of the Kings said: "We weren't trying to make light of this
game by asking Bruce to coach, but we thought it would be a good time to let
him see what happens during a game.
</P>
<P>
"We might have given the impression that this game was not important to us, but
it's only not important until you step on the ice. Then you want to win.
</P>
<P>
"We have three big (Smythe Division) games coming up, and we wanted to play
well.
</P>
<P>
"Before the third period, we asked the guys to go out and try to win the period
to put us in a good frame of mind for going to Calgary, and they did that,"
Ftorek said.
</P>
<P>
The Kings won the final period, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
But that was after the Soviets won the first, 2-1, and the second, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
Dynamo Riga Coach Vladimir Yurzinov said: "I am satisfied with how my team
played tonight. It was a very important game for our team from a psychological
point of view. If we had lost this game, it would have put us in a difficult
position."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the difference between the 2 teams, Yurzinov said: "The L.A. Kings
were not fast tonight. The difference in their speed and ours was just about
the same difference as between us and Vancouver."
</P>
<P>
The Soviets struck for 2 quick goals in the first period.
</P>
<P>
On the first goal, Anatoli Semenov put his stick on the ice to deflect a pass,
which sent the puck flying over goalie Mark Fitzpatrick's left shoulder at
14:38.
</P>
<P>
Andrei Lomakin got an unassisted goal at 15:31 when Fitzpatrick apparently
thought he had made the stop, but the puck had another couple of inches of
momentum. It glanced off his stick and into the corner of the goal .
</P>
<P>
Bernie Nicholls scored the first goal for the Kings at 16:26 of the first
period, a wrist shot from the left circle.
</P>
<P>
The Soviets took a 3-1 lead in the second period, taking advantage of the power
play after Mike Krushelnyski was called for hooking. Sergei Selyanin lifted a
left-handed slap shot over the outstretched glove of Fitzpatrick at 6:47.
</P>
<P>
The Soviets went ahead, 4-1, when Alexi Frolikov picked up a loose puck, turned
and fired from 40 feet away. Dynamo Riga made it 5-1 when Alexander Smirnov
sent the puck from the blue line, through traffic, and past Fitzpatrick.
</P>
<P>
Left wing Bob Carpenter of the Kings suffered a bruised right wrist early in
the third period and was taken to Centinela Hospital Medical Center for X-rays.

MORNING BRIEFING: SOME WINNING QUOTATIONS FROM 1988
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Happy New Year. Here are some selected one-liners from 1988:
</P>
<P>
 Frank King, chairman of the Calgary Winter Olympics organizing committee:
"Wherever I go, people are waving at me. Maybe if I do a good job, they'll use
all their fingers."
</P>
<P>
Jim Valvano, North Carolina State basketball coach and athletic director, on
college administrators: "Monday through Friday, they want you to be like
Harvard. On Saturday, they want you to play like Oklahoma."
</P>
<P>
Julius Erving, on Charles Barkley of the Philadelphia 76ers: "When Charles
first came into the league, his body proportions were out of whack. He looked
more like Dom DeLuise. Now he looks like Michelangelo's statue David. The only
thing that is fat now is his head."
</P>
<P>
Lee Trevino, to a woman who saw him washing the windows at his home and asked
him how much he charged: "Lady, the woman in this house lets me sleep with
her."
</P>
<P>
Billy Martin, asked if he had a drinking problem: "The only problem is that you
run into a guy who's a banker in the afternoon and thinks he's King Kong at
night. If one of those guys tries something with me, I'll drop him."
</P>
<P>
Golfer JoAnne Carner, crediting Martin with teaching her how to win: "The only
thing I never learned from Billy Martin was how to knock a guy out in a bar."
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Mike Scott of the Houston Astros, after the attendance figure of 1938
was put on the scoreboard in Atlanta: "I didn't know if that was the attendance
or the year Nolan Ryan was born."
</P>
<P>
Dodger Manger Tom Lasorda, asked by Chicago reporters how fast Don Sutton was
pitching: "We had him clocked at 92 -- 45 going to Rick Dempsey and 47 coming
back."
</P>
<P>
Coach John Thompson of Georgetown, on the criticism he's received: "It doesn't
bother me. The more I'm criticized, the more my speaking fee goes up."
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rodman of the Detroit Pistons, asked if he would kiss Magic Johnson on
the cheek as Isiah Thomas did: "I think we should get engaged first."
</P>
<P>
Comedian Jackie Mason, claiming Michael Spinks didn't train properly for Mike
Tyson: "He should have taken voice lessons, so he could have yelled for help."
</P>
<P>
CBS announcer Jim Nantz, at a roast for Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson: "The only
time Jimmy didn't run up the score was 27 years ago, when he took the SAT."
</P>
<P>
Coach Lou Holtz of Notre Dame, on his youth: "You hear people talking about an
inferiority complex. Me, I didn't have a complex. I was inferior."
</P>
<P>
David Letterman: "Baseball was an exhibition sport in the Olympics this year --
sort of like it was in Baltimore."
</P>
<P>
Mickey Hatcher of the Dodgers, on Kirk Gibson's ninth-inning home run in Game 1
of the World Series: "I wanted to go out and kiss the guy, but he never
shaves."
</P>
<P>
Oakland's Jose Canseco, on Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser: "I'm going to hire
him as my personal hitting coach."
</P>
<P>
Craig Fertig, former USC quarterback and assistant coach who is the new
associate athletic director at UC Irvine: "There's a rumor we're going to start
playing football. The first call I get is from Terry Donahue. He wants to
schedule us."
</P>
<P>
Lou Holtz, asked the effect the suspension of two players for being late to a
team meal had on the team's punctuality: "At the next pregame meal, our guys
came and watched them prepare it."

STRUGGLING BILLS MAY HAVE THEIR DIFFICULTIES AGAINST THOSE ORNERY OILERS

</DATELINE>

<P>
The Houston Oilers are coming, the Houston Oilers are coming.
</P>
<P>
America's incorrigibles are on the road again, their reputations preceding
them, threatening another hometown darling. Today it's the Buffalo Bills,
playing their first playoff game at home in 22 years before their wild, crazy,
longest-suffering, ready-to-party-hearty fans.
</P>
<P>
The Bills are 3 1/2-point favorites, although a look at their recent record
makes you wonder.
</P>
<P>
Meet the Paper Bills?
</P>
<P>
Buffalo had the league's best record -- 11-1 -- until losing 3 of its last 4.
The Bills were outrushed in the losses, 232 to 110 yards, 110-39 and 53-19, an
ominous sign for a conservative team. Also, Shane Conlan, the inside linebacker
who was a key to their rushing defense until he missed all of the late losses,
is expected to sit out again; quarterback Jim Kelly is under increasing fire,
and some of it is coming from a teammate.
</P>
<P>
That's halfback Robb Riddick, who recently told a TV station in Rochester,
N.Y., "I just don't feel Jim is doing the job he is being paid to do."
</P>
<P>
Riddick was upset that the backs weren't being thrown enough passes, although
you have to wonder which games he has been watching. More than one-third of
Kelly's completions have gone to his backs.
</P>
<P>
Coach Marv Levy was upset with the timing of the remarks and said there was
nothing to it.
</P>
<P>
"Robb came back and called Jim Kelly that night," Levy said. "He told him the
remarks came out much different than he'd expected and apologized for whatever
embarrassment there was.
</P>
<P>
"Jim said, 'Forget it, I know how these things happen, we've got more important
things to deal with than that.' "
</P>
<P>
That Kelly is a brick, isn't he?
</P>
<P>
Of course, he may have been a tiny bit more perturbed than Levy said he was.
</P>
<P>
Kelly is generally considered one of the game's best young quarterbacks, has
just made the Pro Bowl over such candidates as Dan Marino and John Elway . . .
and has been getting ripped in letters to the editor and on radio talk shows by
the arch-supportive Bills faithful. There's a reason for it too -- try 15
touchdown passes against 17 interceptions, compared to the 41-28 ratio he
compiled in his first 2 seasons.
</P>
<P>
Irony: As he starts to get his greatest praise since entering the league, he's
drawing his most heat, too.
</P>
<P>
Bottom line: He's getting angry about it.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so tired of hearing about negative things," he said last week, when the
Riddick question came up.
</P>
<P>
But hadn't Riddick called to apologize, etc.?
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," said Kelly, without enthusiasm, "he called."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Bills still have Bruce Smith (11 sacks in 12 games),
Cornelius Bennett (9 1/2), Fred Smerlas and the rest of that rock-ribbed
defense that got them here. The Oilers, renowned, warm-weather warriors, will
face a more forbidding day than they got last week at Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
The Bills are already braced for all of those Oiler tough-guy tactics, vowing
not to retaliate, as the Browns' Ernest Byner did, earning back-to-back
roughing penalties and killing a drive. However, you might conclude that the
Oilers' Raider-type reputation is already working for them: the Bills are
spending all this time worrying about what the Oilers will do and how they'll
handle it.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Oilers have been on their best behavior.
</P>
<P>
Jerry Glanville, fresh from eliminating the Browns and bringing down their
coaching staff, took it easy on Buffalo, where he was an assistant 1 season. He
said nothing bad about the town, which has provided fertile material for so
many comedians, except to remark that he was leaving tickets for the late Jay
Silverheels, the local actor who used to play Tonto.
</P>
<P>
For a change, the most hated Oiler isn't their macho little coach but General
Manager Ladd Herzeg. It was Herzeg who, in 1987, was accused of having made an,
uh, impolite gesture during an argument at the team's hotel with members of a
wedding party.
</P>
<P>
Assault charges were filed against Herzeg but dropped by a Buffalo judge, on
the condition that Herzeg stays out of local trouble.
</P>
<P>
If those wedding receptions quit hassling him, he'll be fine.
</P>
<P>
AFC Playoff Notes
</P>
<P>
Come Back, Shane: the Bills sent Shane Conlan to Birmingham, Ala., last week to
have Dr. James Andrews look at his injured arch which isn't responding to rest
or therapy. Said Coach Marv Levy: "We're not counting on him, but we haven't
counted him out." . . . Classic confrontation: Houston's offensive line, with
its three, high No. 1 picks (Pro Bowl guards Bruce Matthews and Mike Munchak,
and tackle Dean Steinkuhler) against the Bills' defensive front, which has four
No. 1s (Pro Bowl players Bruce Smith, Cornelius Bennett, Conlan and Art Still)
and two No. 2s (Pro Bowl player Fred Smerlas and Darryl Talley). . . . Key
matchup, or Battle of the Bruces: Oiler left tackle Bruce Davis, the former
Raider, vs. Bill right end Bruce Smith, second only to the Eagles' Reggie White
in potential to disable an entire offense by himself. Smerlas, the colorful
nose tackle, faces center Jay Pennison, who the Raiders considered the Oiler
line's weak link. Of course, the Raiders thought Smerlas was a hype, too. . . .
The Bills are 11-1 when they have rushed for more than 100 yards. However, the
underrated Oiler defense was No. 1 in the American Football Conference against
the run. . . . Levy, on defensing the Oilers: "They're not one dimensional.
There's no one thing to stop. We can't say something like, 'Stop Eric Dickerson
and you'll stop the Colts. It's not that simple. They have a superior offensive
line, great receivers, a fine quarterback (Warren Moon) who gets better all the
time and that tremendous stable of runners."

<P>
BIG TEN COMMISSIONER WILL RETIRE WHEN A REPLACEMENT IS CHOSEN

<P>
One of Wayne Duke's most prized possessions is the clipping from Sports
Illustrated that pictures him with John Wayne at the Rose parade. John Wayne
sent him the clipping and signed it, "To Wayne Duke from Duke Wayne."
</P>
<P>
Wayne Duke, commissioner of the Big Ten, smiles when he tells about that
now-fading momento.
</P>
<P>
So you see, Duke does have some fond memories of the annual trip he has made to
California for the Rose Bowl every year for the past 18 years. But ask him
about the highlights and lowlights of his New Year's Day ritual and he gives
that familiar Wayne Duke grimace.
</P>
<P>
He had been in town less than 3 hours Wednesday and he had already been asked
why the Big Ten can't win the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
Since announcing his retirement last summer, a retirement that will become
effective in the upcoming year when a successor is chosen, Duke has had plenty
of opportunities to review his tenure as leader of the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
The conference boasts the largest football and basketball attendance in the
country, and that comes from winning a lot of games.
</P>
<P>
Duke was chairman of the NCAA basketball tournament committee that expanded the
field to 64 teams and upped the TV rights so that the tournament now brings in
about $55 million.
</P>
<P>
Duke was on the committee that put together a $103 million TV package between
the Big Ten and the Rose Bowl that will run through 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl game is truly dear to his heart. Duke has always been able to
refer to the game as "the granddaddy of them all" without cracking a smile at
the corny sound. He believes it.
</P>
<P>
It's a traditional matchup, and Duke believes that college football should be
more traditional, should match schools and school spirits for the pride and the
memories and the glory, not an abstract No. 1 and No. 2 for a mythical title.
</P>
<P>
"You can have a 'national championship' game in Phoenix this year, or, from
time to time, in Miami, but this game will be sold out year after year after
year," Duke said.
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl is his kind of college football.
</P>
<P>
Walter Byers, the longtime executive director of the NCAA, now retired, who
strongly influenced Duke during his early years in the NCAA office, told the
Chicago Tribune: "We both came from the romantic era in sports. Emphasis was
placed on values to be learned from the game. You competed because you enjoyed
it."
</P>
<P>
While he can get quite philosophical about the over-emphasis on winning and
losing, even at the level of eighth-grade soccer his grandson plays, Duke
cannot deny the impact it has on him to have to see his teams lose.
</P>
<P>
"I go in the dressing rooms," Duke said. "I try to go to our team's dressing
room after any game I see in the conference. I always go down after the Rose
Bowl game. And there's a disappointment in there after a loss. People who are
critical of our bowl record, or even people who are critical of the team's
performance that day, don't have to see, first hand, the terrible
disappointment that is felt by the players and the coaches who have put so much
into the game.
</P>
<P>
"The guy up in the stands who has been tailgating all day and who thinks he has
all the answers, doesn't have to see what losing does to the players and the
coaches."
</P>
<P>
Or what it does to Duke, who has come back up to the pressbox looking so
distressed that writers have joked about keeping an eye on him so he doesn't
jump from the roof.
</P>
<P>
Duke tries to keep smiling. "Tom Hansen (commissioner of the Pacific 10) tells
me I'm a very good loser," Duke said. "I tell him, that's because I've had a
lot of practice."
</P>
<P>
But it doesn't get easier.
</P>
<P>
As he flipped through the pages of his memories, Duke could not seem to
separate good times and bad times in Southern California from the wins and the
losses.
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you the contrast," Duke said. "The first year we were here and
something that happened just last year make a good contrast."
</P>
<P>
The first year Duke and his wife, Martha, came out for the Rose Bowl game,
Stanford beat Michigan. It was after the 1971 season.
</P>
<P>
For the Duke family, it was an emotional time, anyway. He had become Big Ten
commissioner on Sept. 1, 1971, after 8 years as commissioner of the Big Eight
and 11 years of service in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. office. They
had just sold their home of 19 years to make the move to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
After all those years of going to Miami every holiday season for the Orange
Bowl, they were in Southern California -- where it was raining.
</P>
<P>
The Michigan team was having to practice in Bakersfield.
</P>
<P>
Nothing was looking too rosy.
</P>
<P>
And then, the all-important game. In the final minutes of the game, Michigan
got a safety to go ahead of Stanford, 12-10. But Don Bunce, the Stanford
quarterback, took Stanford down the field and Rod Garcia kicked a field goal to
beat the Wolverines.
</P>
<P>
"Martha and I had been talking about how the final standings would go if
Michigan lost, and we knew that Big Eight teams were going to be 1-2-3," Duke
said. "We'd been talking about that for days.
</P>
<P>
"Well, Lawrence Welk was grand marshal of the parade that year, and he was at
the Tournament House that night for the party. He stood up there and said, 'A-1
and a-2 and a-3,' and Martha burst into tears."
</P>
<P>
Not a happy memory.
</P>
<P>
The Dukes decided in subsequent years to skip the party at the Tournament
House. It was a celebration. Often the Big Ten contingent didn't feel like
celebrating. The Dukes would go back to the presidential suite at the Pasadena
Hilton to spend the evening with Big Ten guests.
</P>
<P>
Last season, when Michigan State beat USC, they again skipped the Tournament
House celebration. It wouldn't look right to show up only after a victory.
</P>
<P>
So the Dukes were back in their suite that evening, savoring a victory that,
admittedly, was a "blue collar win . . . a game we won after USC fumbled, but
we'd lost a lot of games that way" when there was a knock at the door.
</P>
<P>
"All the Rose Bowl officers -- Harriman Cronk and all the rest -- came to bring
me my Rose Bowl watch," Duke said. "That was a highlight. They left their
celebration to bring that to me, and I appreciated that."
</P>
<P>
There were some points in their long relationship when some of the Rose Bowl
folks were not too happy with Duke, when he sided with the movement to exclude
the exclusivity clause from the Rose Bowl contract.
</P>
<P>
Some feared that allowing Big Ten and Pac-10 teams to compete in other bowls,
also, would dilute the impact of the Rose Bowl. Duke believed that the Rose
Bowl, matching the champions of the conferences, would remain as strong as ever
while letting more teams compete would be of benefit to both conferences.
</P>
<P>
He was right, as usual.
</P>
<P>
Over the last few years, Big Ten and Pac-10 schools have claimed an average of
40% of the total bowl pot of about $50 million.
</P>
<P>
Duke points out that opening opportunities was good for parity in his
conference, good for attendance, good for recruiting.
</P>
<P>
"When I had just been named commissioner of the Big Eight, and I was only 34
years old at the time, one of the first things I faced was the news that the
Orange Bowl was terminating our exclusive contract," Duke said. "They wanted to
be able to invite the top teams, to have a 'national championship' game.
</P>
<P>
"Sports Illustrated wrote that the loss of that contract would be the death
knoll of the Big Eight. Actually, it turned out to be a boon to the Big Eight.
It opened up vistas for other bowls. We went to the Cotton Bowl, the Sugar Bowl
and the Orange Bowl. It was great for our conference."
</P>
<P>
Since the Rose Bowl changed its policy, and the Big Ten started to compete in
other bowls in 1976, Big Ten schools have taken 56 bowl berths.
</P>
<P>
Duke and his wife have been at a bowl game on New Year's Day for the last 26
years. They might attend a bowl game just for fun next year. Or they might not.
</P>
<P>
If he's not at the Rose Bowl next year, he says he'll miss it.
</P>
<P>
"I've been to most of the bowl games at one time or another," Duke said. "I've
been to all the major bowls -- Orange, Cotton, Sugar. . . . And this is not to
degrade any of the others. But I think the Rose Bowl is special."

FOOTBALL GIVES OKLAHOMA BLACK EYE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
This is a proposal for the governor of Oklahoma, the honorable Henry Bellmon.
Roll up your sleeves, take a broom from the maintenance shed and, in one quick
motion, sweep out the entire administration of the state university ...
specifically the interim president, athletic director and football coach. Not
under the rug, but out the door.
</P>
<P>
It's particularly distressing that violations of recruiting rules have once
again brought deep embarrassment to the school, its faculty and proud alumni.
The University of Oklahoma has been slapped with a three-year probation for
blatant disregard of the NCAA code. Too bad.
</P>
<P>
There's something wrong in the thought process when Oklahoma puts such an
emphasis on winning football games that it pays $1,000 to an athlete and
provides an individual scalping service for varsity players so they can
conveniently pocket the ticket money. If the governor isn't ashamed, then he's
not conversant with what's going on in the state that elected him to provide
proper guidance and supervision.
</P>
<P>
It's personally distressing because we never met a man (or woman) from Oklahoma
we didn't like. We once hitch-hiked from Tulsa to Claremore to visit the Will
Rogers Museum in an effort to learn more about the old rope-spinning,
yarn-telling cowboy philosopher. Our interest in Oklahoma has been so extensive
that it resulted in the state's officially confirming upon us the title of
"Honorary Okie," with an actual certificate and button to go with it.
</P>
<P>
Now Oklahoma, in a football way, has gone and inflicted injury to itself by
drawing still another suspension. This is the fourth time the football program
has been penalized in as many decades. How much longer is this type of
despicable conduct going to continue?
</P>
<P>
The violation shows Oklahoma has found still another way to disgrace itself.
It's also reminiscent of what the former OU president, speaking facetiously,
once said: "We're going to build a university the football team can be proud
of." Humorous or not, it's disgusting that education at Oklahoma is besmirched
by what's going on in the hunt for prospects who can block and tackle.
</P>
<P>
As for Coach Barry Switzer, the NCAA statement declared he "failed to exercise
supervisory control." It's as though he went out to lunch and stayed when the
problems were occurring. The duty to conduct a clean operation belongs to him.
If his assistants and office help were involved in illegal tactics, then he is
the one who should be compelled to pay the penalty.
</P>
<P>
If it was the military and something such as this happened, then the duty
officer in charge would be brought up on allegations of incompetency and maybe
even stripped of his commission. Switzer should be taking the rap for what has
happened. How can he be held blameless?
</P>
<P>
The governor should ask for his resignation by nightfall and advise him to take
his services to Texas A&amp;M, Houston or SMU. The assessment of the charges,
bringing severe discipline, tells the public Switzer doesn't know what's going
on in his own shop, or coaching offices. It's time to assess Barry's value to
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
It would be within the bounds of the governor's authority to suggest Switzer
clean out his desk and be off the parking lot before the band strikes up the
refrain of "Bye-Bye, Barry." It's obvious the transgressions need to be
addressed from the governor's office and dealt with expeditiously.
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma has been thrown for a severe loss. And what did the president, David
Swank, who has the role on a temporary basis, say about it? He reacted by
disclosing the university could lose between $750,000 and $1 million in each of
the next two seasons. Athletic Director Donnie Duncan said, "I think the way of
summing up the way I feel is they wanted us and they got us."
</P>
<P>
This is a play for sympathy, trying to paint a picture of the NCAA
investigators as being biased against the Sooners. That's a cop-out. When one
of the dominant football-playing universities in the land puts itself in this
position, how can it permit the man it pays to head its football show to open
his arms and say he didn't know what the men and women he hired were doing?
</P>
<P>
There has to be a line of responsibility somewhere. And the man out in front
leading the entire effort is the head coach, Switzer. Does he walk away while
two assistant coaches, Mike Jones and Scott Hill, and a recruiting coordinator,
Shirley Vaughan, who was removed from her job, are painted as scapegoats and
burned at the goal post?
</P>
<P>
Switzer is an adult and has been at Oklahoma for 16 years. He knows the burden
is on his shoulders. The university should consider terminating his contract
and suspending football for the next five years. This would demonstrate good
faith and do wonders for reclaiming the clean and ethical reputation Oklahoma
deserves to have.

Alabama may have defeated Northeast Louisiana, but the Crimson Tide took a
beating off the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
Thieves broke into Bryant Hall, the school's athletic dormitory, before
Thursday night's game and stole about $2,000 worth of property belonging to 4
Alabama players, campus police said.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Mark Shockley of the University Police Department said the thieves entered
two rooms Thursday between 6 and 7 p.m., just before the beginning of the
Crimson Tide's 80-65 victory over Northeast Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
"There were some electronic items stolen, some clothes, shoes and items of that
nature," he said.
</P>
<P>
Coach Wimp Sanderson said the thieves stole a television and video cassette
recorder belonging to freshman Robert Horry. Another freshman, Marcus Webb,
lost a gold watch and other items.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the guys lost clothes," Sanderson told the Tuscaloosa News. "Some lost
just about everything they had."
</P>
<P>
Shockley said Bryant Hall "appeared to have been open" at the time of the
heist. "The rooms which they entered also appear to have been open," he added.
"Some other rooms appear to have been tampered with but we are not sure about
that at this time."
</P>
<P>
Sanderson said the thieves "had to be . . . fairly familiar with the dorm. They
would seem to have known where the basketball players live, when they would
have been out of the dorm and they knew the football players and some of the
staff were out of town for Christmas. The basketball players were the only ones
who would have had things there."
</P>
<P>
University police are investigating the crime, and Sanderson also is trying to
help recover some of the stolen items.
</P>
<P>
"If there is anyone out there who knows how to help these guys get their things
back, then I will post a reward," the coach said. "We would really just like to
recover their property."

STEVE PATE RETURNING TO SAN DIEGO AREA -- ONE OF HIS FAVORITES
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mal Florence
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's understandable if Steve Pate is partial to the San Diego area. The PGA
Tour was in its early stages last year and he had already won two tournaments.
</P>
<P>
The former UCLA All-American won the MONY Tournament of Champions at La Costa
followed by a victory in the Shearson Lehman Hutton Open, formerly known as the
San Diego Open.
</P>
<P>
"My goal last year was to win twice and I did it in San Diego, so I'd have to
say it's been a pretty good area for me," Pate said.
</P>
<P>
Pate would, of course, like the new year to be as rewarding as 1988. Winning
early certainly eases any anxiety he might have as to how he's progressing.
</P>
<P>
Pate, 27, who will defend his title in the Tournament of Champions starting
Thursday at La Costa, has steadily advanced on the money list in his 4 years on
the Tour.
</P>
<P>
He earned $89,358 in 1985, $176,100 in 1986, $335,728 in 1987 and $582,473 in
1988.
</P>
<P>
"After that great start I was hoping to win more," Pate said. "I guess I was a
little greedy, but I had a good stretch at the end of the year even though I
didn't win. Coming back to La Costa puts me in a winning frame of mind again."
</P>
<P>
Asked if he has any long-term goals, the Simi Valley resident said: "I'd like
to win every week but, obviously, that isn't going to happen. I'd like to win
more than once this year and defend one of my championships.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't made any major changes in my game, or mental approach. I'm just
getting better at it, like refining my swing. And I don't let bad things bother
me."
</P>
<P>
Pate says the T of C is the best quality field of the year. To qualify one must
win a PGA Tour tournament, or the British Open in the 12 months since the last
Tournament of Champions.
</P>
<P>
And there's quite an attrition rate from year to year. Of the record 38
qualifiers in 1988, only 13 will return to shoot for the first prize of
$135,000 and a total purse of $750,000.
</P>
<P>
Pate, who finished 12th on the money list in 1988, played in 30 tour events in
1988.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to try to play less than 30 tournaments this year, but I hate to
read about people making all that money while I'm sitting at home."
</P>
<P>
The Nabisco Championships last November at Pebble Beach paid Curtis Strange
$360,000 for winning a playoff with Tom Kite.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Nabisco tournament unfairly tilts the money winning total, Pate
said: "I think it does. That it can swing that much in one week I don't think
is particularly fair. But if I had to make a decision of not having the
tournament, or having it, I'd have it the way it is."
</P>
<P>
Pate is sometimes confused by galleries with Jerry Pate, a former U.S. Open
winner, whose career has been curtailed by injuries.
</P>
<P>
Steve Pate takes it in stride.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I look a whole like Jerry," "A lot of people follow me because
they think I'm Jerry. In an offhand way it gives me more recognition.
</P>
<P>
"Some people even ask me about diving in a lake."
</P>
<P>
Jerry Pate made a famous splash after winning the Tournament Players
Championship in 1982 -- and the memory lingers on.
</P>
<P>
As for Steve Pate, he might not be adverse to diving in a lake if he shoots
consecutive rounds of 66 as he did last year on his way to winning the rain
abbreviated T of C by a stroke over Larry Nelson.
</P>
<P>
After he won last year, taking a check for $90,000, Pate said: "I'm not going
to lie to you that I was disappointed that the last round was canceled. A win
is a win. You take it any way you can."
</P>
<P>
He has been sharp lately, shooting a 64 to tie the course record at Kapalua in
Maui in the Kirin Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
It was also a memorable year off the course for Pate.
</P>
<P>
"I was on the fifth hole playing in the Honda tournament when I got word that
my wife, Sheri, was about ready to have our first child. I ran off the course,
set a speed record driving to the Miami Airport and just missed the plane by 2
minutes," he said. "I had to wait 4 hours for the next flight.
</P>
<P>
"In Los Angeles, I raced to the hospital from LAX and missed my daughter
Nicole's birth by an hour. Fortunately, Sheri and Nicole came through in great
shape, but I was a nervous wreck."
</P>

BENIRSCHKE HAS MASTERED HIS NEW JOB, DOWN TO THE LETTER
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY KORNHEISER, The Washington Post
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rolf Benirschke, the excellent former kicker for the San Diego Chargers, is
going to be the new host of the daytime "Wheel of Fortune." A bit of a surprise
choice, wouldn't you say, considering that Rolf Benirschke is not exactly a
household name -- unless you're in the Zendejas house. Really, let's say you're
spinning the wheel, and the puzzle's a name, and B, N, R, S, C, H and K are
already lit, and you buy the I and E. Now you're looking at the whole name, and
you still can't place it or pronounce it, so you're thinking: It has to be a
trick puzzle. "Pat, I'd like to buy an A."
</P>
<P>
Last year in an interview, Vanna White was asked what tips she would give to
Wheel wanna-bes, and she said, "You have to know the whole alphabet."
</P>
<P>
Of course!
</P>
<P>
How stupid I was to think I could get away with stopping at S.
</P>
<P>
The way Benirschke got the gig is pure Hollywood. He was a guest on an L.A.
morning TV show, chatting about staying healthy -- you might remember
Benirschke's near-fatal bout with ulcerative colitis -- and who should be
watching the show but jaunty little rich guy Merv Griffin, creator of "Wheel of
Fortune." Merv was so taken by Benirschke, he offered him the host's job on
"Windfall," Merv's newest game show. According to Benirschke's assistant,
Debbie Marshall, "Merv conveyed this to Rolf: 'You're a genuine, sincere person
who loves people, and that's what I'm looking for.' " Gosh darn it, that's what
separates Merv from the pack, the ability to see all that in one guest shot.
</P>
<P>
As well he should have been, Benirschke was slightly embarrassed. He hadn't
gone to college and majored in zoology to be a game-show host. (Years ago I did
a story on Rick Barry, who told me his ambition was to be a game-show host. He
was the first real, live person to say that to me. Before that, I assumed
game-show hosts were bionic Ken dolls.) But Benirschke agreed to do an
audition. "It was my illness jumping in," Benirschke said, explaining,
"Surviving my illness taught me how neat life really is, and that you should
live it and enjoy all of its experiences and possibilities."
</P>
<P>
Benirschke's audition was so impressive that Merv suggested he forget about
"Windfall" entirely, and aim higher: at The Wheel. In all, 30 tried out for The
Wheel, including Jimmy Connors. (Hard to believe Jimbo knows all 26 letters. He
usually gets stuck on "I"; he must have gotten coaching.) Why Benirschke? This
is a direct quote from Shannon Williams of Merv Griffin Productions: "They
liked his open and sincere quality. He was real sincere with Vanna. He looks
good with Vanna -- that's very important -- they make a good look. (They make a
good look?) Vanna likes him. And he understands the game." Excuse me, the
people who don't understand the game, what stumps them, is it tricky consonants
like J and V? Do they think the game is unfair, that it aims too high up the
intelligentsia ladder?
</P>
<P>
Some will ask if Rolf Benirschke was really the most qualified man to fill Pat
Sajak's shoes. (We're talking gigantic shoes in game-show annal.) Merv liked
him, and that's good enough for me. Don't laugh. Dan Quayle got to be vice
president because George Bush liked him, and that was good enough for you. Come
to think of it, Dan Quayle looks just like a game-show host. Anyway, what are
the qualifications? The ability to spell his own name seems to overqualify Rolf
Benirschke for "Wheel of Fortune." Anybody can spell Vanna White. Well, that
double-N might be too much for some people, but it's not like the only thing
keeping if off PBS.
</P>
<P>
A fine, bright and charitable fellow -- the NFL's "Man of the Year" in 1983 and
co-chairman of the National Foundation for Ileitis and Colitis -- Benirschke
has maintained his sense of humor about his new job. The other day he was asked
if it didn't feel a bit preposterous to be a game-show host, and he said,
"Obviously it does. My father (Dr. Kurt Benirschke) is an internationally known
professor of pathology, a physician, an author, and his son is asking people:
'Do you want to buy a vowel?' "
</P>
<P>
In a sense, it's a breakthrough. Other athletes have become actors, such as Ed
Marinaro, Mike Warren, Fred Dryer and Alex Karras. But game-show hosting is a
whole new field for jocks to consider.
</P>
<P>
Eddie (Silent Movie) Murray, for example. He's well suited for a non-verbal
show like "Win, Lose or Draw." Tommy Lasorda could guest-host, and they could
change the name of the show to "Win, Lose or Eat."
</P>
<P>
Right now, who's in more "Jeopardy" than Jerry Tarkanian?
</P>
<P>
"The Newlywed Game" is a natural for veterans Joe Montana or Hal Sutton.
</P>
<P>
George Steinbrenner could host "The Price Is Right," and yell out, "Billy
Martin, you sly boots, come on down . . . again!"
</P>
<P>
Mike and Robin absolutely have to co-host "Love Connection."
</P>
<P>
For "The Dating Game," the leaders in the clubhouse are Wade (Mr. Polaroid)
Boggs and Mark (Do You Think I'm Sexy, Or Simply Stupid) Gastineau.
</P>
<P>
So Rolf, good luck, we'll be watching. And remember, it's A, E, I, O, U and
sometimes Y.

BRILLIANCE ROUTINE FOR MARIO LEMIEUX
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF JACOBS, The Hartford Courant
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PITTSBURGH
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rob Brown, who resembles Benjamin Franklin and is almost as quotable, looked at
the questioner as if he were some kind of heretic.
</P>
<P>
"Does ANYTHING Mario Lemieux do on the ice surprise me?" Brown, 20, a
Pittsburgh Penguins winger, said, repeating the question. "People who only see
him play once in a while may be shocked when they see Mario make some
incredible move or score some unbelievable goal. But when you see him play all
the time and he's on your team, you are not surprised. You are just thankful
that you can expect his greatness."
</P>
<P>
What Brown is describing is routine brilliance.
</P>
<P>
Routine brilliance.
</P>
<P>
Those two words aren't compatible, because there is nothing humdrum about
greatness. But it is within the domain of night-in and night-out performance
that Lemieux has risen to such a consistent level that even at 23 he is
knocking on the door of immortality. It is difficult to describe this 6-foot-4,
215-pound skating octopus any other way. Lemieux's combination of size, reach,
skill and strength handling the puck are unique.
</P>
<P>
He's a playmaker with a feathery touch and field of vision second only to Wayne
Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
He can work free in front of the net and unleash a sniper's bullet a la Phil
Esposito in his prime.
</P>
<P>
And he uses what seems like 15-foot rubber arms to control the puck and the
tempo of the game like no one else in NHL history.
</P>
<P>
"God only knows what's going to come from Mario Lemieux next," Edmonton's Craig
Simpson said of his former Penguins teammate.
</P>
<P>
"When Gretzky broke 200 points and went on to set the record (215 points in
1985-86), everybody wondered if it would ever be broken," Hartford Whalers
President and General Manager Emile Francis said. "Forget in Gretzky's
lifetime. Lemieux might do it while Wayne's still in his prime."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in his NHL career, the critics complained the kid didn't care enough.
He didn't have enough heart. He was two zones away while his team was on
defense. He turned it on and off as his mood hit and, like the Penguins, folded
down the stretch. All that has changed the past two years.
</P>
<P>
"Wayne Gretzky taught Mario how to win," said Mr. Hockey, Gordie Howe. "In my
mind, Mario became a hockey player at last year's Canada Cup. Before he was a
talent, a great talent. But he was weak defensively and didn't seem to be
involved at all times. Now, he's damn near as good a hockey player as Wayne is.
</P>
<P>
"And he can do things that Wayne isn't physically able to do. The way he uses
those arms and his strength to control the puck when it's about five feet away
from him is unbelievable. That big son of a gun is something else."
</P>
<P>
As much as the Universal Gretzky Adoration Society does not want to admit it,
the time has come when Lemieux perhaps should no longer be held in comparison
to Gretzky. At this point, Gretzky probably should be compared to Lemieux.
</P>
<P>
After being limited to one assist in a 2-2 tie in New Jersey on Friday, Lemieux
entered Monday night's game against the Whalers at the Hartford Civic Center
leading the NHL with 92 points (36 goals, 56 assists) in 33 games. If Lemieux
doesn't miss any more games to injury, his 2.79-points-a-game pace would give
him an NHL record 217 points. His goal pace is headed for 85, which would be
second only to Gretzky's 92 goals in 1981-82. All those projections won't mean
a hill of beans if Lemieux rips off another 41-point barrage like he did in the
first 12 games of this season before missing a few games with a wrist injury.
</P>
<P>
"I want to win the scoring title, with Gretzky (82 points), Bernie Nicholls
(83) and myself there's a challenge," Lemieux said. "I want to be the best I
can. But after a while all the Lemieux vs. Gretzky (comparisons) can get a
little old. I'm sure Wayne feels the same way. I really admire him. But I want
to be recognized as Mario Lemieux and judged on what I can do."
</P>
<P>
"There's got to be some friendly competition between the two," Brown said. "But
Mario hears it so much. Wouldn't you get tired of it, too?"
</P>
<P>
The irony is that Gretzky served as a teacher in Lemieux's maturation process.
Gretzky showed Lemieux the door to immortality, but Lemieux had to be the one
to open it.
</P>
<P>
At the 1987 Canada Cup, Lemieux played on Gretzky's wing. They pushed each
other to a higher level. As Team Canada Coach Jean Perron said at the time,
"Buckle up because we're going into hockey space."
</P>
<P>
The two complemented each other. They challenged each other. Much of it was
done not in words, but in the reflex actions of peerless talents. Lemieux
scored 11 goals in nine games. Gretzky assisted on nine of them.
</P>
<P>
For purists, the three-game Canada Cup series against the Soviets may well have
been the greatest hockey ever played. And the riveting overtime thriller in
Game 2 at Hamilton may have been the greatest single game in hockey history.
Lemieux won it. Gretzky assisted. In the final minute of the decisive third
game, Canada broke the deadlock. Goal Lemieux. Assist Gretzky. Match to Canada.
</P>
<P>
"There is no denying how much winning at the Canada Cup meant to me," Lemieux
said, criticized in the past for turning down invitations to the world
championships after Pittsburgh had failed to make the NHL playoffs. "Wayne was
terrific. It gave me confidence that I could play with the best in the world."
</P>
<P>
Howe is big buddies with Gretzky. It would be a major upset for him to admit
publicly that Lemieux is better. But others have said it.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, Mario Lemieux is the best player in the world," Detroit Coach
Jacques Demers said.
</P>
<P>
A Lemieux vs. Gretzky poll in the Whalers' locker room earlier this season
showed that more players believed Lemieux's talent was No. 1, but that they'd
still want Gretzky when it mattered most.
</P>
<P>
Mike Liut said you don't surpass Gretzky. You can only match him.
</P>
<P>
Brent Peterson said, "For the regular season, I'd take Lemieux. For the
playoffs, I'd take Gretzky."
</P>
<P>
Lemieux cannot be shocked by such talk. Even though Gretzky missed 16 games
because of injury last season, Lemieux scored NHL highs of 70 goals and 168
points to break Gretzky's run of eight Hart Trophies as league MVP. And his
six-point performance in last year's All-Star Game in St. Louis was frightening
in its dominance.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;

<P>
LOUISVILLE ROLLS OVER KENTUCKY

<P>
Cornelius Holden knew Louisville fans were looking for a big victory over
Kentucky Saturday. He and his teammates were more than happy to deliver.
</P>
<P>
"People didn't just want us to beat them," Holden said. "They wanted us to blow
them out."
</P>
<P>
It might not have been a blowout, but the No. 14-ranked Cardinals used a
balanced scoring attack and their superior depth to score a decisive 97-75
victory at Louisville's Freedom Hall.
</P>
<P>
Louisville had not beaten Kentucky since a 71-64 victory in Freedom Hall Dec.
15, 1984. The Wildcats, who had won the last 3 meetings, still hold a 14-6
series advantage.
</P>
<P>
"The victory is a step in the right direction because we finished December
undefeated," said Pervis Ellison, who led Louisville with 20 points.
</P>
<P>
Louisville's reserves, paced by Everick Sullivan with 15 points, outscored
Kentucky's reserves, 31-3, as the Cardinals (7-2) won their seventh straight
game.
</P>
<P>
Louisville Coach Denny Crum said his ability to send in fresh players at will
forced Kentucky (5-7) into an up-tempo game.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing we wanted them to do was to run and shoot in an
up-tempo game," Crum said. "We took advantage of our depth and got good play
off our bench."
</P>
<P>
Consecutive 3-point shots by Derrick Miller pulled Kentucky to within 54-43
with 1:43 left, but Louisville scored 11 of the next 14 points to put the game
out of reach, 65-46, at the 11:20 mark. Kentucky never got closer than 12.
</P>
<P>
Miller led Kentucky with 34 points, including 5 3-pointers. Freshman scored 13
points for the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
Missouri 96, Morgan State 66 -- Lee Coward scored 7 points and Gary Leonard
added 4 during a 20-2 run that gave the Tigers a 36-13 lead with 5:18 remaining
in the first half, and No. 11 Missouri went on to rout the Bears at Columbia,
Mo.
</P>
<P>
Leonard, a senior center whose previous career high was 17 points, led the
Tigers (12-3) with 23. Morgan State's James McCoy led all scorers with 27
points.
</P>
<P>
Morgan State (4-5) was outrebounded, 44-28.
</P>
<P>
Arkansas Little Rock 89, Marshall 79 -- Johnnie Bell scored 20 points and had
13 rebounds to lead the Trojans past the Thundering Herd in the championship
game of the Arkansas Little Rock tournament at Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
The Trojans were ahead, 66-50, with 11 minutes left when Marshall mounted a
comeback to pull within 82-76 with 1:29 to play.
</P>
<P>
Oregon State 72, Clemson 58 -- The victory at Portland late Friday night gave
the Beavers their second straight Far West tournament title. It was their 17th
title in the tournament's 33-year history.
</P>
<P>
The championship also was the seventh for Ralph Miller in his 19 seasons at
Oregon State. Miller, 69, is retiring at the end of this season.
</P>
<P>
Oregon State (7-3) took the lead for good at 44-41 with 15:40 to play on one of
Gary Payton's 4 3-point shots. The basket started an 18-9 run that gave the
Beavers a 59-50 lead on another Payton 3-pointer with 7:26 left.
</P>
<P>
Payton, a junior guard, scored 18 points, had 7 assists and was named the
tournament MVP.
</P>
<P>
The Tigers are 7-2.
</P>
<P>
Illinois 96, Hawaii 87 -- Senior guard Kenny Battle scored a career-high 29
points and Nick Anderson added 26 as the No. 4 Illini remained unbeaten at 12-0
by winning the Rainbow tournament late Friday night at Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
With 14:06 remaining in the game, Chris Gaines gave Hawaii a 60-58 lead when he
scored on a fast-break layup. Anderson, who scored 18 of his points in the
second half, then made a 3-point play with 13:48 to go, giving Illinois a lead
it never relinquished.
</P>
<P>
Hawaii (7-4), which lost its first home game, was led by Reggie Cross with 24
points.
</P>
<P>
No. 17 Georgia Tech beat Purdue, 72-69, for third place.

Zola Budd says she would like to run again for Britain but that she never will
denounce apartheid despite pressure from opponents of the racial separation
laws of her native South Africa.
</P>
<P>
In an interview telecast on Britain's ITV network, the former world champion
middle-distance runner said that although her personal beliefs do not favor
apartheid, she would refrain from public criticism of the South African regime
or its policies.
</P>
<P>
"I will never regret not denouncing apartheid," she said. "I have strong views
about South African politics and I still don't feel I need to make public
statements."
</P>
<P>
Budd returned to South Africa from Britain last spring after anti-apartheid
groups applied pressure to keep her from competing for her adopted country in
the world cross-country championships in New Zealand.

STEROID REPORT A REVELATION TO CIF HIERARCHY;
</P>
<P>
'EPIDEMIC' SURPRISES ADMINISTRATORS, COACHES
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The heads of 2 commissions that oversee athletics in all public high schools in
Southern California said that they were surprised by the findings of a recent
national survey indicating that 1 of every 15 boys in 12th grade has used
anabolic steroids. Both said that they have never received a report of a
student using the muscle-building drug.
</P>
<P>
But a national expert on drug abuse said that steroid use among high school
students is rising sharply and is at epidemic levels in some Southern
California communities.
</P>
<P>
"It's a frightening situation," said Dr. Forest S. Tennant of West Covina, a
leader in the treatment of substance abuse. Tennant has treated many
professional athletes for cocaine dependency, including former Dodger pitcher
Steve Howe and NBA star Walter Davis. "I have seen blood-test results from
users of anabolic steroids. I have been shocked to see the dramatic effects
they have on the human body."
</P>
<P>
Tennant, who operates a drug abuse treatment center in Van Nuys, said that his
studies have shown steroids to have a dramatic impact on the adrenal gland and
the immune system and to cause cholesterol levels to soar in most users.
</P>
<P>
A study published last month in the Journal of the American Medical Assn.,
purported to be the first nationwide survey of steroid use among high school
boys, found that of the 3,403 seniors interviewed at 46 schools, 6.6% of them
said that they were using or had used steroids. Most said that they took the
drug to enhance their athletic performance, but 26.7% were non-athletes who
said that they used steroids to build muscles and improve their physical
appearance.
</P>
<P>
Stan Thomas, the commissioner of the of the California Interscholastic
Federation Southern Section -- which oversees more than 500 schools -- said
that his organization has never had a report of steroid use by a local high
school athlete.
</P>
<P>
"None. Not a single report," Thomas said. "But I am certain it goes on. It's
like marijuana use in your high school. You'd be crazy to say it doesn't go on.
It's the same thing with steroids.
</P>
<P>
"But I am just overwhelmed to hear those numbers. The numbers are scary."
</P>
<P>
Hal Harkness, the director of interscholastic athletics for the City Section --
which oversees 49 Los Angeles School District programs -- said that he knows of
no incidents involving steroid use by athletes in city schools.
</P>
<P>
"I have had no calls about it, ever," he said. "I have heard absolutely no
comments in over two years in this position from anyone in our schools
regarding steroids."
</P>
<P>
Tennant said that the reason for the lack of reports on steroid use by students
is that coaches and administrators don't know what they're looking for.
</P>
<P>
"If they are waiting to get reports on steroid use like they get reports of
kids using marijuana or cocaine, then they will never get any reports," Tennant
said.
</P>
<P>
"Steroids are not taken in that manner, at lunchtime or at smoke break at
school. Steroids are taken in a very programmed way, at a very intentional time
and place, most likely away from the school. Users of cocaine and marijuana
take those drugs when they are passed to them."
</P>
<P>
The study reported that more than one-third of the seniors who said they have
taken steroids took them both orally and by injection. Only one-fifth of those
who claimed to use steroids said they got the drugs from a health-care
professional. The majority obtained the steroids from other athletes, coaches
and people who frequent gyms, the study said.
</P>
<P>
Tennant said that he began to see widespread steroid use among adolescents 4
years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The figures in the national study just released are not only believable, but
in Southern California I think they are higher than that," he said. "It is
spotty. In some communities people have never seen or heard about anabolic
steroids. In others, it's an epidemic. As long as four years ago, I had
substantiated reports of parents and coaches giving steroids to Little League
baseball players and Pop Warner football players.
</P>
<P>
"This study is a validation of something I have seen for the last four years. I
support what it said and I agree with its findings."
</P>
<P>
Tennant was especially alarmed at the reasons some steroid users gave for
taking the drug.
</P>
<P>
"The most frightening aspect of steroid use is that adolescents are using them
to alter their basic physical appearance," he said. "They perceive that doing
that will make them more sexually attractive or give them some success in life
that they can't achieve otherwise. It symbolizes something that has gone sour
in our society, that our natural body and our natural talents are not worthy
anymore."
</P>
<P>
Bill Redell, a veteran high school football coach who recently resigned from
his post at Crespi High, said that he encountered only 1 player at Crespi whom
he suspected of using steroids. But he said that the results of the national
study are not unexpected.
</P>
<P>
"It didn't surprise me a bit to see those numbers," said Redell, who also
played and coached in the defunct U. S. Football League. "The pressure on the
kids today to win, and to perform well, is greater than ever. There are parents
who pressure their own kids into taking steroids, not only not condemning
steroid use but actually encouraging it. The pressure is to gain major college
scholarships."
</P>
<P>
Canyon High Coach Harry Welch, who has run the Valley-area's most successful
football program for the past 7 years, said that he has never encountered
steroid use among his players.
</P>
<P>
"We discuss drugs but I haven't discussed steroids because I've never seen the
need," he said.
</P>
<P>
Welch added that he condemns steroid use, equating it with so-called
recreational drugs.
</P>
<P>
"It really scares me," he said. "I've read that it affects the reproductive
system. To even flirt with using something that could affect your sexual
identity or the future of your children . . . I would condemn it in the
harshest way."
</P>
<P>
Cleveland High Coach Steve Landress found it difficult to believe the
statistics, saying that he has never heard of high school athletes -- or
students -- using steroids during his 13 years of coaching.
</P>
<P>
He especially ruled out athletes, saying top players have no need for such
drugs at the high school level.
</P>
<P>
"Guys who are Division I-type players are so much better than other players
they don't need it," he said. "Even a few years ago when it wasn't such a big
thing to say you used steroids, I never heard anyone talk about it."
</P>
<P>
Thomas said that the Southern Section has never discussed the issue of steroids
with coaches and has never sent memos to coaches informing them of indications
of steroid use by players.
</P>
<P>
"I guess we felt it should be common sense," Thomas said. "If a kid goes from
165 pounds to 205 pounds in six months, a coach should have a clue that
steroids might be involved. I guess we assumed they would know. But I'm not
satisfied anymore with where we are with this issue. We have to do more."
</P>
<P>
Thomas, however, said that the Southern Section has no firm plan to deal with
steroid use. He said that the organization is involved in an educational
program sponsored by the Los Angeles Amateur Athletic Foundation and is
participating in another steroid awareness program sponsored by the Orange
County Sheriff's Deparment.
</P>
<P>
"We have run articles about steroid use in our football game programs," Thomas
said.
</P>
<P>
Testing players for steroids has never been seriously considered, he said.

"I honestly have to admit we have been remiss in the world of drug abuse,"
Thomas said. "Drugs are a problem in our high schools in general, but the CIF
Southern Section should take a leadership role (against) drug abuse, including
the use of steroids."
</P>
<P>
Harkness said that the City Section may implement a steroid awareness program
early next year. There will be no drug testing, however.
</P>
<P>
"We will not even consider voluntary drug testing," he said. "To begin with,
voluntary testing is not effective. Those individuals who even think they might
test positively for steroids simply won't volunteer for the testing. And
mandatory testing is absolutely out of the question. We just don't have the
right to do that and it wouldn't even be considered."
</P>
<P>
Tennant said that the solution is a massive and immediate educational program.
</P>
<P>
"The educational pitch is simple," he said. "No. 1, sports are here only to
spend a little time in your young years competing, learning team spirit and
discipline and fitness and competition. Anabolic steroids just don't have a
place in that. They don't belong, and don't use them. Ever. They will hurt you.
</P>
<P>
"And we have to repeat that message to our kids, over and over. Repetition.
That's how we got people to wear seat belts and to brush their teeth and to
lose weight. You keep giving them this message, again and again: Don't use
steroids."

BASKETBALL RACE SHAPES UP AS RERUN;
</P>
<P>
DEFENDING CHAMPIONS VENTURA, SANTA MONICA FAVORED IN REALIGNED WSC
</P>

<P>
Santa Monica and Ventura.
</P>
<P>
That is the answer, which comes without hesitation, from Western State
Conference basketball coaches asked to name the favorites in this season's race
for the WSC title.
</P>
<P>
"Those two are head and shoulders above everyone else in the conference
talent-wise," Glendale Coach Brian Beauchemin said. "Everybody else is right
there together."
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica and Ventura shared the championship last season with 11-2 records,
and no one affiliated with the conference is bold enough to predict that it
might not be a similar scenario this time around.
</P>
<P>
The WSC has been slightly realigned after the defection of Allan Hancock
College to the Central Valley Conference and the entry of Valley and West Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Valley, which played in the Southern California Conference last season, and
West L. A. will join the South Division, which also includes Santa Monica,
Canyons, Glendale and Bakersfield. The North Division comprises Ventura,
Moorpark, Cuesta, Santa Barbara and Oxnard.
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Coach John McMullen grudgingly admits that his Corsairs may be the
team to beat.
</P>
<P>
"I suppose on our preseason record and returning lettermen that's the case,"
said McMullen, whose team is 15-3 and has won the Rancho Santiago, Compton,
Merced and Pasadena tournaments. "If that's true, we're not that far ahead of
anybody else. I've seen Valley, Canyons, Moorpark and Glendale, and they're all
competitive."
</P>
<P>
Indeed, all of the Valley-area teams have tasted success during the
preconference schedule.
</P>
<P>
Canyons (9-8), though plagued by inconsistency, has looked spectacular at
times.
</P>
<P>
The Cougars finished 8-5 in the WSC last season and made the playoffs for the
fourth year in a row. This season, they finished second in the Glendale
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Lee Smelser, in his 20th season as coach at Canyons, said the WSC likely will
be one of the best conferences in the state. Whether his team will be among the
best in the conference, however, will depend on its ability to eliminate
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
"We're in a manner of transition, trying to be halfway decent and struggling,"
said Smelser, whose team opens WSC play Tuesday at West L. A. "We haven't been
able to put the whole package together. That's been kind of frustrating."
</P>
<P>
For a variety of reasons, Glendale (9-6) lost 4 players -- potentially, a
strong nucleus -- from a young team that finished 6-7 in the WSC last season.
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros, who open WSC play Wednesday at Santa Monica, are once again a
young outfit, but the team has shown steady improvement despite its youth.
</P>
<P>
"We're doing all right considering what happened," said Beauchemin, who is in
his 10th season with the Vaqueros. "The players are starting to respond."
</P>
<P>
Valley (10-6), which joins the WSC after competing in the Southern California
Conference, has a talented team led by center Oral Elrington and could give
some teams trouble if the Monarchs are able to develop depth. Valley's first
test comes Wednesday at Bakersfield.
</P>
<P>
Moorpark (8-7 entering the weekend), though dominated by freshmen, should
improve steadily under Al Nordquist, who is in his 22nd season with the
Raiders.
</P>
<P>
Point guard Roger Thomas, a freshman from Leuzinger High, is averaging 10.9
points a game to lead the Raiders. Moorpark opens its conference schedule
Wednesday at home against Cuesta.
</P>
<P>
Oxnard, which finished 1-12 last season, is the most improved team in the WSC.
Santa Barbara won its own tournament and also is considered a conference dark
horse.
</P>
<P>
But in a conference with Santa Monica and Ventura, every team is a long-shot to
displace the reigning co-champions.
</P>
<P>
Ventura (13-2 entering the weekend) might have lost conference MVP Cedric
Ceballos, but the Pirates have been buoyed by the play of all-conference point
guard Tony Walker, who is averaging 9.6 assists, and freshman forward Reggie
Betton, who is averaging 13.9 points.
</P>
<P>
Ventura, which opens WSC play Wednesday at Santa Barbara, has won the Cypress
and Ventura tournaments.
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica has 7 players back from a team that lost to Merced in the
quarterfinals of the state tournament last season, including All-WSC forward
Keith Amerson, forwards Von Shuler and Kemo Patrick and guards DeShawn Pullard
and Troy Batiste, all of whom average more than 10 points.
</P>
<P>
"It looks to me as if this is one of the strongest conferences overall in
Southern California," McMullen said. "I feel that everybody has a team that can
beat anybody else on a given night."

FACES TO WATCH NEXT SEASON:
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HIGH SCHOOLS
</P>
<P>
Chris Alexander, Hawthorne track -- The state's dominant track team continues
to produce blue-chip talent. The latest could be Alexander, who was on the
state champion relays last June as a freshman. He also plays football, but a
broken arm ended his season early.
</P>
<P>
Piper Hahn and Kristal Attwood, Mira Costa volleyball -- Mira Costa bowed out
in the CIF 5-A finals, but then this was a rebuilding year with an entirely
underclass lineup. Hahn figures to be one of the top prep players in the nation
next year, with Attwood not far behind.
</P>
<P>
Steve Clover, Rolling Hills basketball -- The junior guard has blossomed into
one of the Southland's top 3-point shooters and will be a coveted college
recruit next year when he will be out of John Hardy's shadow.
</P>
<P>
Lisa Leslie, Morningside basketball -- College coaches will have to wait for
the next dominating center, because she'll only be a high school senior next
year. The 6-foot-5 Monarch is already rated in the top handful of female
players in the nation.
</P>
<P>
Nkosi Littleton, Carson football -- The Colts' all-star defensive tackle may be
the most athletic lineman around next year. The only non-senior on the All-City
first team, the 6-2, 210-pound junior is also one of the school's best
basketball players.
</P>
<P>
John Ma'ae and Derek Sparks, Banning football -- Opponents have to cringe at
the thought of quarterback Ma'ae, who will be a three-year starter, handing off
to the powerful running back Sparks, who emerged this year as a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
COMMUNITY COLLEGES
</P>
<P>
Marcel Bridges, Harbor College football -- It was difficult for a receiver to
stand out in Harbor's offense, but the talented freshman earned all-conference
honors and all-state honorable mention. Now if the Seahawks can only find a
quarterback. . . .
</P>
<P>
Frank Dolce, El Camino College football -- El Camino has been "Quarterbacks R
Us" for most of the decade, and Dolce will return with some impressive stats.
Most impressive -- he led the Warriors to their second straight PONY Bowl
title.
</P>
<P>
Raul Haro, El Camino College soccer -- The L.A. high school player of the year
wasted no time establishing himself on the community college level, leading the
Warriors to the Southern California Conference title while earning SCC Player
of the Year honors.
</P>
<P>
UNIVERSITIES
</P>
<P>
Devon Akita, Dominguez Hills volleyball/basketball -- Two programs trying to
establish themselves are counting on the 5-7 sophomore. She may have the talent
to earn all-conference honors in both sports.
</P>
<P>
Robert Barksdale, Dominguez Hills basketball -- In Dick Vitale slang, the Toro
sophomore guard is a "Dow Joneser" -- up and down. But by the time he's a
senior the 6-foot-1 Barksdale could be the best shooting point guard in school
history.
</P>
<P>
Miah Bradbury, Mike McNary and Tim Williams, Loyola Marymount baseball -- The
Lions have had a string of All-Americans in recent years, and this trio is
bidding to join them. Bradbury, a strong-armed, heavy-hitting catcher, was one
of the hitting stars of the NCAA Regionals last spring. McNary, a poised
sophomore right-hander, toils in lefty Steve Surico's shadow but figures to be
a staff mainstay. Line drives jump off the bat of Williams, also a sophomore,
who is looking for a home either at first or in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
Chuck Donlon, Loyola Marymount volleyball -- The Lions' men's team is trying to
turn the corner, and Donlon may be the cornerstone in becoming more
competitive. The 6-6 sophomore may be Loyola's best player since Olympian Paul
Sunderland in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Joe Flanagan, Dominguez Hills soccer -- The Toro forward was outshined this
year by the scoring of transfer Willie Ayala -- who also returns -- but
Flanagan figures to end his senior year leading the Toros in virtually every
career offensive category.
</P>
<P>
Terrell Lowery, Loyola Marymount basketball -- Hank Gathers, Bo Kimble and Jeff
Fryer figure to be filling up the basket again next season, but the key man in
Paul Westhead's offense is the point guard, and the slender freshman figures to
be the one getting them the ball.
</P>
<P>
Kristi White, Dominguez Hills soccer -- The midfielder has earned post-season
honors for the Toros, but Coach Marine Cano is still waiting for her to develop
the scoring touch he anticipated. If she blossoms as a senior, the Toros could
have a devastating attack. ALAN DROOZ

GRANADA HILLS SCOUT RATES FOOTBALL PROSPECTS TO PROVIDE SHOPPING ASSISTANCE BY
THE NUMBERS

<P>
Foster Andersen at a high school football game: He draws a bead on an offensive
lineman's feet. Are they quick feet? Or slow feet? Then he focuses on a
defensive back's hips. How fast can they switch gears from forward to reverse?
Next, he zeroes in on a receiver's hands. Soft or hard? And the quarterback's
arm. How strong?
</P>
<P>
To Andersen, winning isn't everything, anatomy is. Every week during the
football season, he sees a minimum of 3 high school and 2 junior college games.
He doesn't care about results. He doesn't root. He just scrutinizes hands and
feet and hips and arms and puts all the body parts together to form a
well-rounded opinion of a player.
</P>
<P>
As the owner of Sports Search, a scouting service he runs out of his Granada
Hills home, Andersen judges football prospects and sells his evaluations to
major colleges such as USC, UCLA and Miami.
</P>
<P>
This past season, he and 2 associates analyzed the college potential of 400
high school and 400 junior college players in the vast football caldron of
Southern California. That's a lot of body parts.
</P>
<P>
"But I never get tired of going to games," says Andersen, 48, a two-way lineman
for UCLA in the early 1960s and former head coach at Cal State L. A. "It's the
parking that bugs me."
</P>
<P>
Scouting services such as Andersen's are in vogue -- USC subscribes to about 50
-- because the NCAA has tightened the screws on recruiting. As of this year,
colleges cannot even scout a prospect until Nov. 1. To cover ground quickly and
thoroughly, they buy reports from scouting services, which rate the best
players. Andersen sells his service for as much as $800 a year for voluminous
compilations or as little as $75 for, say, a breakdown on quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
"Our reports allow a college staff to prioritize its time," Andersen says. "We
tell them who they should concentrate on and who's a waste of time."
</P>
<P>
The fear of missing a blue-chip player also drives colleges to subscribe to
scouting services. "We cross-reference players rated by the various services,"
says USC recruiting coordinator Jack Himebauch.
</P>
<P>
Andersen assigns a rating to each player he scouts. The best is a 1+, which
represents "the guys I'd want if I were coach at USC or UCLA," he says. Players
rated as a 1 or 1- are Division I caliber. A 2+ would be the best player
available for Division II schools. Of the 400 high school players he has
evaluated this year, "150 are capable of playing in Division I and maybe 30 are
rated 1+," he says.
</P>
<P>
But his ratings are not chiseled in stone. Colleges use scouting services as an
aid, not a directive, often disagreeing with or ignoring their recommendations.
"Coaches still make their own evaluations," Himebauch says. "They don't rely on
somebody else's opinion to offer a player a scholarship."
</P>
<P>
Last year, Andersen says he was pushing Jack Swan of El Camino Royal High as
"the best offensive lineman in the Valley." But neither USC nor UCLA recruited
him, Andersen says, because at 6-3, he was shorter than their prototype
lineman. But one of Sports Search's subscribers, the University of Georgia,
gave Swan a scholarship and "think they stole him out of Southern California,"
Andersen says.
</P>
<P>
Andersen puts all his information in an IBM computer in the family room of his
ranch house. Players are listed alphabetically and by position. Aside from
ratings, Andersen includes capsule comments on each player, "little bits of
information coaches like." Typing on the computer keyboard -- "I had to learn
to type to go into this business," he says -- Andersen called up Hart High
tight end Brian Allen. The comment read:
</P>
<P>
"Catches with hands. Doesn't look like he'll fill out for different positions
because of body type."
</P>
<P>
Andersen explained, "Coaches don't necessarily like receivers who catch the
ball against their pads, and they also want to know if a prospect has the
potential to play other positions," such as offensive or defensive line.
</P>
<P>
In the analysis of Crespi running back Russell White, Andersen mentioned that
he could also be "a great defensive back." White, of course, got Andersen's
highest rating despite nagging injuries and a "weak offensive line" this
season. "I watched him in practice," Andersen says, "and his work ethic is
very, very good."
</P>
<P>
But who is the best back in the L. A. area? Andersen likes Hawthorne
quarterback Curtis Conway, projecting him as a college tailback. Andersen's
computer comment says Conway "may be the next Marcus Allen."
</P>
<P>
An assistant coach at USC under Ted Tollner, Andersen was out of a job when
Larry Smith brought in his own assistants 2 years ago. So Andersen, along with
computer expert Dick Laugens, started Sports Search, hiring former USC
assistants Larry Bryan and Nate Shaw to help with the scouting. They specialize
in Southern California players "because California supplies 15% of the players
in Division I," Andersen says.
</P>
<P>
Andersen has opinions on where to find the best players in the area. "Banning
and Carson have the premier concentration of athletes in public schools," he
says. "In private schools, it's Loyola and Crespi. They have good coaches and
an administration that wants football to be a unifying force on campus."
</P>
<P>
Andersen says that San Fernando High has the best talent in the Valley this
year and Orange County "is where you'll find the great linemen." Inner-city
schools, he says, "traditionally produce great running backs and receivers."
</P>
<P>
Andersen sometimes disagrees with all-star teams, which he says are based on
"politics." For instance, the Golden League put defensive lineman Sean McCune
of Canyon High on its second team. "I think he'd leave some of the first team
in the dirt," Andersen says. He gave Granada Hills defensive lineman Anthony
Hall a 1+ but Hall didn't make All-North Valley League.
</P>
<P>
Although the 1988 season is behind him, Andersen will not be taking it easy
until the fall.
</P>
<P>
Scouting is a full-time, year-round job. "We're working on our spring list --
juniors in high school," he says. So he will be attending spring practices --
and watching lots of body parts.

PADRES
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With apologies to David Letterman, we offer lists detailing what happened in
1988 and, in some cases, how 1988 will impact 1989.
</P>
<P>
 Seven reasons the Padres' 1989 season will be different from 1988:
</P>
<P>
1. They won't have to worry about a club president making an obscene gesture to
the fans on Fan Appreciation Night.
</P>
<P>
First, the Padres no longer have a club president. Chub Feeney resigned last
fall within hours of wagging an obscene right-hand gesture at some heckling
fans.
</P>
<P>
Second, Feeney has reportedly moved back to the comforts of San Francisco,
where his gesture is the social equivalent of a handshake.
</P>
<P>
Third, if club officials are smart, they will hold this year's fan appreciation
activities during an afternoon game. Even if Feeney chooses to fly down for an
encore, he'll probably be napping at that hour if last year's routine is any
indication.
</P>
<P>
2. They won't have to worry about a manager engaging in a fist fight with any
players.
</P>
<P>
Larry Bowa is gone. Stanley Jefferson is gone.
</P>
<P>
And the last person dumb enough to mess with Jack McKeon, Bowa's replacement,
still has the cigar burns to prove it.
</P>
<P>
3. They won't have to worry about firing a manager at 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
It worked with Bowa, who was canned on May 28 in New York while still in his
pajamas. But it won't work with McKeon. Virtually every day on the road at 7
a.m., he's in church. Considering the erratic history of Padre management,
that's not a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
4. They won't have to worry about losing a starting third baseman for 3 days
with a bruised tooth root.
</P>
<P>
Chris Brown is gone.
</P>
<P>
Come to think of it, the Padres also won't have to worry about losing a
starting third baseman for a week because he twisted his heel walking off the
field.
</P>
<P>
Or worry about losing a starting third baseman for a week because he hurt his
thumb sucker-punching one of the club's reserve outfielders (Marvell Wynne).
</P>
<P>
Or worry about losing a starting third baseman for 5 minutes during the middle
of the game because of a broken jockstrap.
</P>
<P>
Where did Chris Brown go?
</P>
<P>
Does it matter?
</P>
<P>
5. They won't have to worry about their home-run hitter turning a cartwheel
after a home run.
</P>
<P>
Keith Moreland is gone, having been shipped with Brown to Detroit. In Detroit,
the players turn cartwheels following every home run, delighted that they have
just trotted 360 feet in public without being shot.
</P>
<P>
The Padres' new home run hitter, Jack Clark, turned his first and last
cartwheel when he found he was being traded here from the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
Jack McKeon was dumb enough to try a cartwheel just once, and he has the cigar
burns to prove it.
</P>
<P>
6. They won't have to worry about any frustrated manager or fan wanting to tear
Jimmy Jones' face off.
</P>
<P>
The mild-mannered and erratic starting pitcher has been traded to the New York
Yankees. The latest New York Post insta-poll says his face won't make it to the
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
7. They won't have to worry about pitcher Andy Hawkins' shoulder.
</P>
<P>
Hawkins became a free agent and signed with the New York Yankees for about
double what he would have been paid in San Diego, partially because the Padres
were worried about a right shoulder that caused him trouble in 1987 and may
have hindered him late in 1988.
</P>
<P>
In his first press conference as a Yankee, he said he was looking forward to
moving out of San Diego and settling his wife and family in New York. The
Yankees aren't worried about his shoulder -- they are worried about his head.

AMERICA'S CUP
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With apologies to David Letterman, we offer lists detailing what happened in
1988 and, in some cases, how 1988 will impact 1989.
</P>
<P>
 Seven reasons why the 1988 America's Cup defense was a farce:
</P>
<P>
1. It did not occur to New Zealand's Michael Fay that Stars &amp; Stripes would
be a catamaran.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand had made its surprise challenge in a 90-foot monohull in July 1987,
assuming Sail America would respond in kind.
</P>
<P>
The Kiwi challenge, based on a literal interpretation of the America's Cup Deed
of Gift, was upheld in the New York Supreme Court in November 1987.
</P>
<P>
But the same literal interpretation of the Deed of Gift caused Sail America to
respond with the catamaran.
</P>
<P>
2. San Diego, home of the San Diego Yacht Club, was left hanging for months on
whether the 1988 races would be held off the San Diego coast.
</P>
<P>
At one point, the City of San Diego was actually rebuffed in court in an
attempt to assert its right to be a party to the competition.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, on Jan. 22, Sail America announced that the races would be held off
either Long Beach or Hawaii. In March, Sail America finally announced that the
races would be off the San Diego coast in September.
</P>
<P>
3. Michael Fay complained about Stars &amp; Stripes' commercialism.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the Marlboro logo on Stars &amp; Stripes, New Zealand hoisted a
sail that said: "Surgeon General's Warning: Quitting Smoking Now Greatly
Reduces Serious Risks to Your Health" in the days leading up to the first race.
</P>
<P>
Curiously, Stars &amp; Stripes skipper Dennis Conner was race commodore for an
American Cancer Society regatta.
</P>
<P>
4. Michael Fay whined and complained about how horrible this mismatch was going
to be.
</P>
<P>
For months and months, he complained.
</P>
<P>
Encountering a couple of women bicyclists near the Kiwi compound, he said: "Do
you ladies know what this race will be like? Why, it will be like you two
racing your bicycles against motorbikes."
</P>
<P>
Just before the racing, Fay announced the results of a Kiwi-commissioned Gallup
Poll which concluded that 53% of Americans thought the race was unfair.
</P>
<P>
He did not make a big issue of the fact that 51% of Americans polled were
unaware of any such controversy.
</P>
<P>
5. The races were horrible mismatches.
</P>
<P>
Stars &amp; Stripes won the first race by 18 minutes 15 seconds on Sept. 7 and
concluded a sweep of the best-of-three series with a 21-minute 10-second
victory 2 days later.
</P>
<P>
6. Sportsmanship was as horrible as the competition.
</P>
<P>
The Kiwis accused Conner of intentionally sandbagging to keep the margin of
victory from being even greater than it was.
</P>
<P>
"I consider what they did to be disgraceful," skipper David Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
"They should have gone out there and beaten us by 1 1/2 to 2 hours," designer
Bruce Farr said.
</P>
<P>
That was after the first race. After the second race, a press conference turned
into a literal and verbal shoving match with grown men called each other liars
and losers.
</P>
<P>
7. It's not over.
</P>
<P>
Naturally, Michael Fay went back to the New York Supreme Court to ask that the
race be forfeited to New Zealand because of how unfair it was that his monohull
had to race against a catamaran.
</P>
<P>
Presumably, the outcome of this continuing legal hassle will provide a farcical
beginning to 1989. DAVE DISTEL

<TEXT>
<P>
With apologies to David Letterman, we offer lists detailing what happened in
1988 and, in some cases, how 1988 will impact 1989.
</P>
<P>
 Six steps that made the Sockers' spring and summer seem like a walk through
the Twilight Zone, or the Museum of the Hard-To-Believe:
</P>
<P>
1. There's a sign post up ahead, and your next stop is ...
</P>
<P>
The first indication this would not be a typical year came April 25. Ron
Fowler, the chairman of Sockers' Management Inc., filed for protection from
creditors in a Federal Bankruptcy Court under Chapter 11. This action came
despite the Sockers' status as one of the most successful franchises in league
history.
</P>
<P>
2. They come back, but Segota goes.
</P>
<P>
In Game 7 of the Western Division finals on May 28, Branko Segota, the Sockers'
leading scorer, injured his shoulder and was lost for the remainder of the
playoffs. The Sockers advanced to the MISL Championship Series against the
Cleveland Force without him, beating the Kansas City Comets, 8-5.
</P>
<P>
There was a sign the Kansas City series would be bizarre in Game 3, when the
Sockers blew a 6-1 lead in the fourth quarter and lost in overtime, 7-6. Kansas
City had a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series before the Sockers rallied.
</P>
<P>
3. Break up the Sockers.
</P>
<P>
The great all-star Sockers team of the 1980s played its last game together on
June 7 and produced a 7-4 victory over Cleveland, wrapping up a four-game sweep
of the MISL Championship Series and a sixth title in seven years.
</P>
<P>
Because of salary cutbacks, it was apparent that players such as Segota, Juli
Veee, Hugo Perez, Kevin Crow, Fernando Clavijo, Zoltan Toth and Jim Gorsek
would not all be able to come back for another season.
</P>
<P>
But Cleveland saw the Sockers at their best in the final game. Waad Hirmez
notched a hat trick, and Perez broke a 4-4 tie with 3:34 remaining.
</P>
<P>
4. Fowler makes his bid ...
</P>
<P>
After it became obvious that nobody else was interested in buying the
franchise, Fowler announced an offer to buy it out of bankruptcy for $825,000
on June 17.
</P>
<P>
Fowler's bid was eventually lowered to $470,000. He will also threatened to
withdraw it on June 29.
</P>
<P>
5. . . . but on second thought . . .
</P>
<P>
On the morning of July 8, Fowler arrived in court and was told by local
reporter that the Tacoma Stars and Chicago Sting had folded, leaving the league
with seven franchises.
</P>
<P>
Fowler, who maintained all along that the league must have at least eight
franchises to exist, called a press conference that afternoon and announced
that soccer in San Diego was pretty much dead.
</P>
<P>
Less than a week later, a group in Tacoma announced that it was going to try
and re-start the Stars. So Fowler kept his offer alive.
</P>
<P>
Tacoma was eventually re-started, but Cleveland folded on July 22. After a
weekend's worth of meetings, the league decided to try another season with
seven teams.
</P>
<P>
Fowler, who had come this far, elected to stick it out, and his second bid is
accepted by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Peter W. Bowie on July 29.
</P>
<P>
6. Back to soccer.
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 5, after the team's most tumultuous off-season, the Sockers opened
their 1988-89 season against the Los Angeles Lazers. Gone were Gorsek, Hirmez,
Veee, Perez, Clavijo, Brian Schmetzer, Raffaele Ruotolo and Jacques Ladouceur.
</P>
<P>
As if to put on exclamation point on the summer's activities, ex-Sockers Hirmez
and Gorsek led the Lazers to a 5-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 22, the Sockers signed Steve Zungul, the top scorer in the history of
the game. Reunited with Segota, Zungul goes on a scoring spree (six goals in
his first six games) and the Sockers are 7-7 going into the New Year. CHRIS

With apologies to David Letterman, we offer lists detailing what happened in
1988 and, in some cases, how 1988 will impact 1989.
</P>
<P>
 Everything else you wanted to know about but were afraid to ask:
</P>
<P>
1. A Pair for Pate.
</P>
<P>
Steve Pate thought San Diego was a great golf town.
</P>
<P>
On windy Sunday Jan. 17, after three delays because of rain and one because of
hail, the Tournament of Champions was called off, and Pate was declared the
winner after 54 holes at La Costa. Pate was awarded the $90,000 first prize for
his 14-under-par score of 202, one stroke better than Larry Nelson.
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 21, Pate sank a 6-foot putt for a birdie on the final hole for a
1-stroke victory over Jay Haas in the Shearson Lehman Hutton Andy Williams Open
at Torrey Pines Golf Course. Pate became only the second golfer to win the San
Diego double -- the T of C and the Andy Williams. (Tom Watson did it in 1980.)
Pate's putt gave him a final round of 68 and a 72-hole total of 19-under par
269.
</P>
<P>
Pate also will be the last Andy Williams winner. After a 21-year affiliation,
the Century Club of San Diego announced Nov. 22 that Williams has ended his
involvement as host of the tournament. It will now be known as the Shearson
Lehman Hutton Open.
</P>
<P>
2. The meet belongs to Olympians.
</P>
<P>
A host of track and field stars showed up at the Michelob Invitational outdoor
track meet in June.
</P>
<P>
Double Olympic gold medalist Jackie Joyner-Kersee took just three long jumps.
Two were fouls, but her first -- 24 feet 3 inches -- was just 2 1/2 inches
short of her American record. After competing, Joyner-Kersee attended the
wedding of UCLA's Gail Devers, formerly of Sweetwater, and Ron Roberts, a
former Bruin distance runner.
</P>
<P>
Florence Griffith Joyner -- Flo Jo -- gave an indication of Olympic glory to
come, winning the 100 meters in 10.89 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Mary Decker Slaney had an easy time in the 2,000 meters, winning in 5 minutes
36.35 seconds. Ramona Pagel became the first American woman to surpass 20
meters in the shot put with a throw of 66-2 1/2.
</P>
<P>
3. And the rest of the story.
</P>
<P>
 -- Joan Hansen, a Solana Beach distance runner, decided not to try to compete
in her second Olympics in 1988, opting instead to help start the San Diego
National Athletes Fund, a nonprofit corporation designed to raise money for
local athletes in training. In '84, Hansen ran in the 3,000-meter race with
Mary Decker. Both fell, but few knew about Hansen because of the controversy
surrounding Decker, who didn't finish. Hansen did, placing eighth.
</P>
<P>
 -- Major League Volleyball was a major league bust in May. Just 254 fans
showed up for a match between the New York Liberties and the Chicago Breeze.
The Breeze won. The MLV lost. The paltry attendance figures didn't entice San
Diego investors to support a team here.
</P>
<P>
 -- In June, it was announced that San Diego State and USD would not play each
other in men's basketball for the first time in 9 years. The rivalry was put on
hold for a year because the two schools could not agree on a date.
</P>
<P>
 -- An estimated 3,000 athletes descended on San Diego to participate in 13
sports at 25 venues in the inaugural California State Games in mid July.
</P>
<P>
 -- In the men's open division championship of the 35th Over-the-Line
tournament at Fiesta Island July 17, the Beachcomber team of Steve Miner, Billy
Bright and John Torchia came out of the loser's bracket to defeat the Pennant
Pups for the title.
</P>
<P>
 -- Christy Erb of Bonita and Kevin Kemp of Greensboro, N.C. won the girls' and
boys' 15-17 divisions of the Optimist Junior World Golf Championships at Torrey
Pines July 22.
</P>
<P>
 -- With 8 seconds to play and the game tied, 14-14, Torrey Pines fullback Tim
Walker kicked a 39-yard field goal to give the San Diego Section All-Stars a
17-14 victory over the Los Angeles City Section team at Mesa College July 30.
</P>
<P>
 -- Roger Gunn of Napa won the Buie San Diego County Open with a 6-under-par-66
on the North Course at Torrey Pines Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
 -- Stephanie Rehe breezed by Ann Grossman, 6-1, 6-1, to win the Virginia Slims
of San Diego singles title Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
 -- Some top names were missing Aug. 12, but after a 4-year hiatus, the NBA
returned to the San Diego Sports Arena for an all-star game that included
former Aztec Michael Cage and Morse High alumnus Cliff Levingston (35 points,
MVP).
</P>
<P>
 -- A local all-star team returned home in mid August after winning the
International Boys' Baseball Friendship Tournament in Bejing, China.
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Dodd, who attended SDSU, and Tim Hovland won $50,000 in the Cuervo
Gold Crown volleyball series Sept. 17 at Mission Bay's Mariner's Point.
</P>
<P>
 -- Two drivers in the championship race of the Miller High Life Thunderboat
Regatta at Mission Bay Sept. 18 escaped serious injury when the
turbine/jet-powered hydroplanes boats they were racing flipped over and broke
apart after being launched by a gust of wind.
</P>
<P>
 -- Wayne Gretzky had a goal and an assist for the Los Angeles Kings, who lost,
5-4, to the Winnipeg Jets in an exhibition before a sellout crowd of 13,155 at
the Sports Arena Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
 -- Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut was the first gymnast inducted into the
International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in Oceanside on Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
 -- Rockers Bobby Blotzer of Ratt, "Motor City Madman" Ted Nugent and Tommy Lee
of Motley Crue finished 1-2-3 in the Dodge International Star Challenge car
race on Oct. 22 at the Del Mar Fairgrounds. The next day, Tom Hessert won the
championship race of the Camel Grand Prix of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
 -- Former world record-holder and 2-time Olympian Tom Petranoff of Oceanside,
along with several other track and field athletes, was suspended indefinitely
by The Athletics Congress for participation in a series of meets in South
Africa. TAC serves as the U.S. agent of the International Amateur Athletic
Federation, which does not sanction meets in South Africa because of that
government's official policy of racial separation. KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, and DON

CHINO ENDS POINT LOMA'S HOME WINNING STREAK AT 143 GAMES

There is nothing discrete about the state championship banners that hang in the
high school gym at Point Loma High. The four gold-and-maroon flags represent,
in part, the accomplishments of the Pointer girls' basketball teams, which
until Saturday afternoon had won 143 consecutive games there.
</P>
<P>
But Chino (12-0), the defending Southern Section 2-A champion from the Baseline
League in Pomona Valley, wasn't intimidated by the banners, the streak or the
gym and said so in a resounding 50-39 victory for the championship of the Ben
Fisher tournament.
</P>
<P>
"They have those four banners hanging here," Chino Coach Joe Murillo said. "We
wanted to see what it would be like to come down here and play a ranked team."
</P>
<P>
They found out. Using a zone defense to negate Point Loma's speed, Chino was
able to curtail the scoring of Monica Filer and Tyeast Brown, who were held to
6 and 11 points, respectively. Sophomore Chris Drumm led the Pointers with 15,
including a fourth-quarter 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
"We just couldn't match up with them," Point Loma Coach Lee Trepanier said.
"Big people wear you down, and they did a good job of it."
</P>
<P>
Point Loma's tallest player is Brown at 5-feet 11-inches. Chino has four
players who are taller than 6 feet.
</P>
<P>
"We're tall," Murillo said. "Sometimes the kids don't realize we can take
advantage of that. In the third quarter, we started taking advantage of our
size."
</P>
<P>
The third quarter proved to be Point Loma's undoing. The Pointers had leads of
14-12 after a quarter and 22-21 at halftime, but Chino came out and outscored
Point Loma, 14-6, in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Point Loma was also hurt by its free-throw shooting. The Pointers were just 4
of 10 from the line.
</P>
<P>
With the loss, Point Loma must start another winning streak from scratch.
</P>
<P>
"Records are made to be broken," Trepanier said. "So now we start a new one.
You don't get better if you don't play better teams, and we're still the best
team in San Diego County."
</P>
<P>
Felicia Franke and Francine Moreno led Chino with 22 and 10 points.
</P>
<P>
In other tournament games:
</P>
<P>
Poway 56, Oceanside 39 -- Dawn Gigstad and Julie Schwan each scored 12 as Poway
took third place.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry 49, Bonita Vista 36 -- Bonita Vista was able to stay within six
points of Patrick Henry until the fourth quarter, when several turnovers cost
the Barons in the fifth-place game. The Patriots outscored Bonita Vista, 19-10,
in the final quarter. Rochelle Johnson (23) and Sorii Epps (14) combined for 37
of Patrick Henry's points. Johnson also was the leading rebounder with 17.
</P>
<P>
San Marcos 43, Chula Vista 35 -- San Marcos (4-1 in the tournament, 5-5
overall) led, 28-15, at halftime but lost some momentum when the game's leading
scorer, Susie O'Brien (20) collected her fourth foul and left at the start of
the third quarter. Chula Vista pulled within 38-35, but with 6 minutes
remaining, O'Brien returned and San Marcos pulled away to take seventh place.

AZTECS TAKE LOW-KEY ROAD, BUT GET BY VERMONT

<P>
Vermont certainly is not North Carolina. The first clue came midway through the
first half of Saturday's Vermont-San Diego State basketball game, when a
Catamount pass on a fast-break attempt catapulted out of bounds off a Catamount
head.
</P>
<P>
The second clue came early in the second half. SDSU was leading by five with
17:47 left when Aztec Coach Jim Brandenburg called a timeout. Shawn Bell -- in
the midst of his best game at San Diego State -- walked to the bench and looked
at the scoreboard. Then he yawned.
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs won, 83-76, but the atmosphere in the San Diego Sports Arena wasn't
exactly as festive as Thursday's 103-92 loss to North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
"I would have rather been in a dental chair with no novocaine than endure that
for 40 minutes," was the way Brandenburg explained it.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,529, the fewest to attend an Aztec home game since 836 watched
SDSU play Hawaii in the final game of the 1986-1987 season, watched SDSU
improve to 6-4. Against North Carolina, the Aztecs had set a home attendance
record of 13,106.
</P>
<P>
The fallout from the empty arena reached the court, where it was so quiet you
could hear the ball drop. SDSU had 21 turnovers and Vermont 18. Both teams shot
48% from the field.
</P>
<P>
"And my New Year's resolution was to not take another drink all year long,"
Brandenburg said. "But I think (the letdown) was very evident -- and
predictable. We were tremendously emotionally high Thursday, and when you get
that high, you valley out. We valleyed out really bad."
</P>
<P>
One of the spectators at the North Carolina game was on the Vermont bench
Saturday, and Tom Brennan, the Catamount coach, got exactly what he had hoped
for.
</P>
<P>
"We caught them at the right time," said Brennan, whose team is 1-5 and has
lost 10 consecutive road games. "After playing in front of 13,000 rockin' and
rollin' fans Thursday, and then to play in front of (something like) 13 . . . I
kept saying 'stay ahead, stay ahead' (to the Aztecs) Thursday because I knew
there had to be an emotional letdown."
</P>
<P>
Bell, a transfer from Chicago State, finished with 22 points and 10 rebounds --
both personal bests at SDSU. Guard Tony Ross had a season-high 23 points, and
his four second-half 3-pointers (he had five total) sparked the listless Aztecs
enough to stop a handful of Vermont comebacks.
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs built a 12-point halftime lead, 38-26, as Bell surpassed his
9.8-point scoring average with 15. Vermont whittled it down to five, 40-35,
just 2 minutes into the second half and eventually cut it to three, 52-49, with
12:09 remaining.
</P>
<P>
It was 55-51 with 10:38 left, but Ross made three 3-pointers in the next 3:24
to give SDSU some room to breathe.
</P>
<P>
"Shawn and Tony came through for us when everyone else was really struggling,"
Brandenburg said.
</P>
<P>
Said Brennan: "Ross and Bell were great tonight."
</P>
<P>
SDSU guard Bryan Williams wasn't bad, either. He had 9 assists, giving him 19
for the last two games.
</P>
<P>
"We tried to get up for this game, but a lot of people were tired," Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
Said Aztec center Mitch McMullen: "It was a win. You've got to take every one
you can get."
</P>
<P>
McMullen, who had career highs of 29 points and 12 rebounds against North
Carolina, managed just 10 points and 5 rebounds before fouling out with 2:41 to
play. Joe Calavita led Vermont with 20 points.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: RECORD-SETTING EFFORTS LEAD CHRISTIAN HERITAGE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two records fell, and the Christian Heritage men's basketball team scored 21
points in overtime to defeat Point Loma Nazarene College, 123-114, Saturday
night at Granite Hills High.
</P>
<P>
In his first game for Christian Heritage, junior forward Brad Soucie, a
transfer from Eastern Michigan, scored 46 points and broke the single-game
school record (33) set last year by his brother, senior forward Bill. Brad
Soucie, who also holds the NCAA Division I playoff record for the most 3-point
goals in a game (8) had six 3-pointers against the Crusaders.
</P>
<P>
Mark Kraatz had 19 assists to break the school record he set last year.
</P>
<P>
Christian Heritage (10-2) now has the best record in NAIA District 3 after its
second victory this year over Point Loma Nazarene (2-8). Christian Heritage
evened its all-time mark against PLNC at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
Regulation ended at 102-102.
</P>
<P>
Will Cunningham had 20 points and Kraatz added 17 for the winning Hawks. Mark
Ryan and Mark Bulgin led Point Loma Nazarene with 35 and 26 points. Bulgin had
four 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
The Hawks were 43 of 67 from the field and 28 of 37 from the foul line. Point
Loma Nazarene was 44 of 82 from the field, 15 of 22 in free throws.
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
</P>
<P>
U.S. International University (2-10) lost its ninth in a row, 84-74, to
Missouri at the Larry Lawrence Community Center in La Jolla. USIU had an 18-10
lead early but was tied at 31-31 on a 16-foot shot by Missouri's Marcia Brooks.

Was 1988 the year of the dead in the Orange County arts scene? Well, it was the
year Pacific Symphony conductor Keith Clark was termed "a dead fish," the year
William Shakespeare was nearly a dead duck in Garden Grove and the year the
rock zanies in Oingo Boingo held yet another "Dead Man's Party" at Irvine
Meadows Amphitheatre.
</P>
<P>
 Jokes notwithstanding, there were encouraging signs of life locally. South
Coast Repertory Theatre won major national recognition with the 1988 Tony Award
as best regional theater in the country. The Grove Theatre Co. triumphed over
considerable civic adversity that threatened for a time to shut down the
county's only annual Shakespeare festival. The Pacific Symphony demonstrated
new enthusiasm, with concerts led by guest conductors vying for the
soon-to-be-vacated music director post.
</P>
<P>
Local rock bands seemed to flourish, live and on record, despite a paucity of
clubs in the county that would book them or radio stations that would air their
music. The Improv in Irvine paved the way for a significant increase in the
quantity and quality of stand-up comedy in the county.
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, in the following four pages critics for The Times Orange
County Edition offer compendiums of the best -- and in some cases, the worst
and the silliest -- that the county had to offer during the year in art, music,
dance, theater, pop and comedy.
</P>
<P>
 *"Chris Burden: A 20-Year Survey," at the Newport Harbor Art Museum. Orange
County's major art exhibition of 1988, a massive display of prickly and
sometimes downright ornery works that are ultimately revelatory of a
continually questioning, first-rate mind.
</P>
<P>
*"The Figurative Fifties," at Newport Harbor. Another major show, conceptually
not as strong as it might have been but with important work on paper by Willem
de Kooning and terrifically ebullient pieces by the likes of Larry Rivers,
Grace Hartigan and George McNeil.
</P>
<P>
*"The Early Works of Charles E. Burchfield," at the Laguna Art Museum. The
year's most enjoyable historical show, with passionate, idiosyncratic paintings
by an American original.
</P>
<P>
*Works from the Pauline Hirsh collection at Laguna Art Museum and the museum's
South Coast Plaza annex. Provocative early pieces by several mostly
lesser-known contemporary artists.
</P>
<P>
*The Lorrin and Deane Wong collection at the Art Institute of Southern
California. Pieces by important contemporary American and European artists,
many of whom have never shown in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
*"Bare Facts, Sly Humor," at the Irvine Fine Arts Center and "Suburban Visions,
Middle-Class Dreams," at the Muckenthaler Cultural Center in Fullerton. Recent
unconventional work in photography and a timely subject illustrated with some
wonderfully quirky picks. Both of these shows were part of "Photography: Inside
Out," a countywide series of exhibits that helped boost the level of community
art center offerings this year.
</P>
<P>
* Angie Bray's "Night Lies" installation at BC Space in Laguna Beach: An
installation tapping
</P>
<P>
deep psychological veins via artlessly simple means, and also very possibly a
breakthrough for the Laguna Beach artist.
</P>
<P>
*"Inside Out" at BC Space. Shattering images and voices of the mentally ill
imprisoned in a locked ward (by Mary Ellen Mark) or trying to make it on their
own in the "real" world (by Lonnie Shavelson) -- surely the year's most
significant show addressing a major social issue. CATHY CURTIS

</P>
<P>
 *International star Fernando Bujones danced Lensky in John Cranko's "Onegin"
as a guest with the National Ballet of Canada, June 7 to 12, at the Center. But
the company was not lacking in its own roster of dancers. Among a trio of
casts, Sabina Allemann was a most lyric, expressive Tatiana, and Frank Augustyn
a cold, world-weary Onegin.
</P>
<P>
The Canadians also brought Glen Tetley's "Alice," with Kimberly Glasco as a
melting Young Alice and Rex Harrington as a Byronic Lewis Carroll.
</P>
<P>
As a curtain-raiser, the company danced no less than Balanchine's profound "The
Four Temperaments" -- and danced it superbly.
</P>
<P>
*Merche Esmeralda brought demonic power, shattering intensity to "Medea" during
the Royal Spanish National Ballet run at the Center, Aug. 2 to 7.
</P>
<P>
*American Ballet Theatre unveiled a costly new staging of "Swan Lake" by
company artistic director Mikhail Baryshnikov during its Nov. 29 to Dec. 11 run
at the Center. Five pairs of Swan Queens and Siegfrieds danced in Orange
County.
</P>
<P>
ABT excelled in Balanchine's masterpiece, "Stravinsky Violin Concerto."
</P>
<P>
Also during ABT's run, three former members of Twyla Tharp Dance company (Kevin
O'Day, Jamie Bishton and Daniel Sanchez) -- folded into the New York company
now that Tharp is artistic associate of ABT -- appeared in her inventive,
virtuoso "The Fugue," danced to silence.
</P>
<P>
*The dance department at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa sponsored two dance
and music events in October and netted about $3,000 to benefit ACTION (AIDS
Coalition to Identify Orange County Needs), a 4-year-old grass-roots
organization that provides educational services and coordinates informational
meetings for the public, among other aims.
</P>
<P>
Participating groups included Rhapsody in Taps (formerly LTD/Dance Unlimited),
the Gloria Newman Dance Theatre, Ecos de Espana, Middle Eastern dancer Angelika
Nemeth and composer Lisbeth Woodies. CHRIS PASLES

UTILITY SUES IN THEFT OF POWER
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. filed a $500,000 lawsuit against a Lakeside
couple for allegedly stealing more than $40,000 worth of gas and electricity
from the utility over three years. Beth Eagleson, SDG&amp;E's corporate
attorney, said Friday that the suit against Jerry P. and Cathy A. Goulart seeks
to recover punitive damages and about $42,500 worth of energy stolen from the
utility. "Based upon measurement of actual use compared to their load
information, a back bill for gas and electric service was prepared," Eagleson
said. According to company spokesman Dave Smith, load information refers to the
energy used by household appliances. The law allows utilities to try to recover
the cost of stolen electricity, plus treble damages. In this case, Eagleson
said, that amounts to $127,789.50. In addition, she said, SDG&amp;E is seeking
$300,000 in punitive damages. Eagleson did not say how the Goularts' case was
discovered. According to the San Diego County district attorney's office,
criminal charges are also involved. In addition to fiscal penalties, Eagleson
said, "It's important to remember that energy diversion is also dangerous."

THE YEAR IN REVIEW;

<P>
1988: A HUMBLING YEAR FOR THE MIGHTY
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Orange County in 1988, the natural disasters were few. The human misfortunes
were many.
</P>
<P>
The ground didn't shake too much, and even the drought-parched canyons did not
ignite. True, there was the winter storm early in the year that caused the
newly rebuilt Huntington Beach Pier to collapse.
</P>
<P>
But that was nothing compared to the collapse of careers and the tumbling of
stature among many of the county's once-towering figures.
</P>
<P>
It was the year that the mighty fell:
</P>
<P>
* A rising star in the Republican Party plummeted when he forged a signature on
a check in a last-ditch effort to bail out his campaign for Congress.
</P>
<P>
* A millionaire video producer from Newport Beach was charged with making
illegal campaign contributions to failed Democratic presidential hopeful Gary
Hart and other candidates.
</P>
<P>
* An Orange County supervisor, running for Congress, was caught red-faced when
it was revealed that she did not graduate from college, as her biographies
stated.
</P>
<P>
* Even the always-powerful Orange County Republican Party took it on the chin
when it posted uniformed security guards at polling places in Latino areas of
Santa Ana to warn non-citizens not to vote, prompting an FBI investigation into
allegations of voter intimidation.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, 1988 was the election year that many people would like to forget.
</P>
<P>
In January, the venerable Rep. Robert E. Badham (R-Newport Beach), a six-term
congressman, surprised supporters by announcing that he would not run for
reelection, which opened the door to a free-for-all that led to a promising
young politician's demise.
</P>
<P>
C. David Baker, Irvine city councilman and former college basketball star,
seemed to be the heir-apparent to Badham's seat until C. Christopher Cox gave
him a run for his money in the June primary. And when that money began to run
short in the final days before the election, a desperate Baker turned to the
bank account of a nonprofit health foundation that he directed for an advance
on a loan that was a few days late. He wrote a $48,000 check to himself,
signing his own name and forging the signature of a judge, a foundation
director. He stopped payment on the check shortly after it was written, but the
damage was done.
</P>
<P>
Baker, who was narrowly defeated by Cox, pleaded guilty to a felony forgery
count, but a Superior Court judge later reduced the charge to a misdemeanor.
The judge ordered Baker to perform community service and gave him a year's
probation and a 1-year suspended jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of what the penalty was today, this will not be over," Baker said
on the day he was sentenced. Even when the sentence was imposed, Baker was
delivering hot meals to the elderly and working with children. "Some good will
come out of this one way or another. I'm not really sure how."
</P>
<P>
Another legislative seat unexpectedly opened with the death of Assemblyman
Richard E. Longshore (R-Santa Ana) the day after voters nominated him for a
second term.
</P>
<P>
That opened up a king-sized contest between Republicans and Democrats for his
seat, and that race, too, led to a finish-line stumble.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sent Out the Guards
</P>
<P>
In their fervor to see their candidate, Curt Pringle, win, county Republican
Party officials not only got out the vote on Nov. 8, they also sent out the
guards.
</P>
<P>
Uniformed security guards were hired by the party to stand watch at heavily
Latino polling places to warn people that it was illegal for non-citizens to
vote. The Democrats cried foul, and even high-ranking Republicans denounced the
move. The FBI and district attorney's office are now investigating whether
election laws were violated, and several Latino and labor organizations have
filed suit to overturn the election results in the 72nd Assembly District,
where Pringle ended up winning by a mere 867 votes.
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder's election foibles left her with a red face.
Running for Congress in the June primary, Wieder conceded under pressure from
her opponent that she had left uncorrected a 25-year-old error on her biography
that stated she had received a bachelor's degree in journalism from Wayne State
University in Detroit. In truth, she was unable to attend college because of
family finances. Also under fire from slow-growth advocates for her votes on
development agreements, Wieder lost the race.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Karl Stubbed His Toe
</P>
<P>
Republicans did not have a monopoly on election-year problems. Stuart Karl Jr.,
the millionaire producer of the Jane Fonda workout tapes, was fined $60,000 and
placed on 3 years' probation for making $185,000 in illegal campaign
contributions to self-destructing presidential candidate Gary Hart and others.
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, I'm not sure why I did these things," Karl said after his
sentencing. "You're attracted to the lure of being involved. People begin to
make you feel important. I should have looked deeper and not done the things I
did. . . . "
</P>
<P>
Hamburger magnate Carl N. Karcher also took a tumble. Known for his fast food
and patriotism, the founder of Carl's Jr. restaurants was accused by the
federal government of insider trading, for allegedly tipping off his relatives
about some bad news that his company was about to release. While a federal
judge has ruled that Karcher's son, Carl Leo Karcher, did engage in the illegal
behavior, the case against the senior Karcher is still pending.
</P>
<P>
"These charges are totally false," Karcher said after the civil lawsuit was
filed in April. "My wife and I did not sell any of our stock, nor did we tell
anyone else to do so. . . . To suggest that any of us would intentionally
violate the securities laws is highly offensive."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crystal Cathedral Cutback
</P>
<P>
Even God's squad was taken down a notch or two in 1988. While televangelist
Robert H. Schuller stayed clear of the scandals that rocked his collared
colleagues, the fallout hit the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove. In May,
Schuller announced sharp cutbacks in his "Hour of Power" broadcast ministry, a
result of reduced contributions because of televangelism scandal "shock waves,"
the October, 1987, stock market crash and the decision by a New York City cable
television station to eliminate paid religious programming.
</P>
<P>
Still, not everyone had a bad 1988. Braving the Siberian cold, marathon swimmer
Lynne Cox of Los Alamitos became the first person to navigate a significant
distance across the Soviet Union's Lake Baikal, the world's deepest lake.
America's darling and Placentia's own Janet Evans won three gold medals in the
pool at the Summer Olympics in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
And despite the misfortunes of other politicians, two former White House aides
were launched on promising careers. Cox, after toughing it out with Baker in
the congressional primary, sailed to easy victory in November. Dana
Rohrabacher, after tipping off voters to Wieder's erroneous resume, was elected
to the 42nd Congressional District post that was vacated by Daniel E. Lungren
(R-Long Beach), who tried -- and failed -- to become the state's treasurer.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Comeback
</P>
<P>
Still, there was perhaps no bigger political comeback in Orange County in 1988
than the one that took place on a gentle hillside in Yorba Linda.
</P>
<P>
The honoree was not able to attend, but hundreds of supporters gathered to
watch a bulldozer scrape up the first bucket of dirt where a library soon will
stand to house the papers and mementos of Orange County's native son and the
nation's only resigned president, Richard M. Nixon.

collected and spent nearly $2 million, poured it on as the election neared.
Those favoring growth controls spent little and campaigned less for the failed
measure. MARK BOSTER / Los Angeles Times; Photo, Anaheim Motorcycle Officer

when about 250 feet of the pier's end was ripped off by waves such as these on
Jan. 18. Plans are for the pier to be rebuilt, reopening possibly in the spring
of 1991. KEN HIVELY / Los Angeles Times; Photo, A crowd of 1,500 gathered in

NONPARTISAN LOCAL ELECTIONS:

Our readers wrote letters throughout 1988 expressing their viewpoints on a
variety of issues. Here are condensed versions of some of those letters. We

</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo's elections were marked by an evil partisanship that destroys
the fabric of a local community. There are many very good reasons that city
councils, supervisors, school boards, judges, city attorneys and planning
commissions should not be elected on a national political party basis.
</P>
<P>
The chief rationale is that the issues they decide involve quasi-judicial
functions and executive-legislative interpretations.
</P>
<P>
Neither party serves the local constituency well by attempting to influence the
voter to vote along party lines.
</P>
<P>
The motivation is purely selfish and defeats the essence of local control. The
issues are essentially nonpartisan.

Pamela Dilday-Davis on leash laws:
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach police have finally caught up with me. After a year of
reckless disregard for the law, I was cited recently for walking my dog off the
leash. I have difficulty with the leash law, which dictates that all dogs, even
those with no criminal record, have to be restrained when outdoors. No such law
pertains to the roving gangs of tough cats. The officer allowed that he thought
it was indeed a shame that dogs in Newport Beach had no place to run free. I
don't walk Sophie without a leash anymore. I'd like to say that I've been
rehabilitated. But every once in a while, when it's dark and no one can see us,
the old urge to run free takes hold, and we're off on another crime spree in
the streets of Newport Beach.

Donald A. Sizemore on the homeless:
</P>
<P>
For all our concern with morality we are confronted daily with an immense evil
that few seem to care about and fewer still seek to halt. That evil is
homelessness in Orange County, and its companions: poverty, illness and hunger.
For most, accustomed to our county's image of prosperity, it is virtually
impossible to believe that thousands of Orange County residents are living in
conditions reminiscent of the Appalachia of 3 decades ago. For the few who
become aware of this issue there is always the comfortable lie that the poor
deserve their rags, malnutrition and loss of dignity. The truth is a horrifying
indictment of Orange County's values and priorities -- both public and private.
It takes only $4 a day to shelter, feed and assist the homeless. The issue is
seldom a lack of resources -- it is usually lack of concern, leadership or, in
a very real sense, a lack of morality when it comes to the poor.

David Camplin on drug use:
</P>
<P>
I see the problem every day I'm in school. Friends ditch school to go to the
beach and do drugs. Friends skip class and go to a field to smoke a quick
joint. People in my classes sell paraphernalia as well as the drugs right in
class. I see kids destroying their lives with such substances as pot, cocaine,
crack, acid, speed and many other drugs. We've got to wage a war against drug
abuse. Some users just need someone to accept them and be their friend --
outside of the drug circles. We need to care enough to listen and be willing to
help them. If drug users do not respond to that we need to inform as many
authorities as necessary to get the person off drugs. I've seen some beautiful
lives produced from horrible ones because they were forced into programs.

Jerry Collins on new fatherhood:
</P>
<P>
Life doesn't begin at 55, but it sure can take a fresh turn. It has for me . I
have a baby son. It's an odd feeling being a father again. A daughter, 25, a
son, 18, and a baby. I must take note of the change in the delivery process.
Back in the '60s, husbands had little to do with it. It was a mother's affair,
and the doctor's business. The husband's principal task was to stay out of the
way -- just get mom to the hospital in time. This time I was there. In the
delivery room, actually being helpful. The years and the participation in the
delivery have given me new perspective on new little human beings. I look upon
them for what they are, not what they will be. They are struggling, curious,
funny and courageous. Little things mean a lot to them. Children are children.
They are not, nor should they ever be expected to be, small adults. Twenty
years ago, it couldn't have been this way. Fathers felt foolish pushing their
babies along in strollers, or sharing a rattle with them in a public park. Not
today. Fathers may now feel a little clumsy, but not foolish. That's the way it
is with Jeremy and me.

<P>
 In every survey of Orange County issues and in every poll of attitudes,
transportation and traffic congestion consistently emerge as the No. 1 concern
on people's minds today. But we don't need polls and surveys to tell us traffic
is a problem. And we can all feel the frustrations of thinking that no one,
anywhere, is doing anything about it.
</P>
<P>
Well, some positive things are being done: widening the San Diego Freeway,
rebuilding the aged Santa Ana-Costa Mesa freeways interchange and lengthening
the Costa Mesa Freeway past the Orange County Fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
These freeway improvements are only one part of our energetic effort to meet
our transportation problems head-on. New transportation facilities are needed.
More flexible work hours, more ride-sharing and other transportation-management
techniques are on tap.

<P>
 To vote or not to vote? That was the question Orange County voters faced Nov.
8. That question became difficult in the 72nd Assembly District when the Orange
County Republican Party sent uniformed security guards to 20 Santa Ana
precincts to intimidate Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
As a registered Republican, even I am amazed at how bold our leaders have
become. Our elective process is founded on the principle that the voter not be
intimidated at the ballot box. Not since the 1960s have such tactics been used.
They were unjust then, and they are outrageously unjust now.

 Let's look at growth in Orange County as if we all had a stake in tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
One way or another, our children are going to pay for the countless ills
brought about by unwise development. There's still time, however, to move into
the next century with style.
</P>
<P>
Let's work together to find ways to preserve open space and recreation land, to
develop affordable housing, to create jobs, to control traffic and to improve
the quality of life. Nuts to those of limited vision who would surrender our
future to past mistakes.

Jeff Fister on high-priced housing:
</P>
<P>
I recently made my first trip back to Southern California after moving from
Orange County. I opened up the newspaper and read, among other things, that the
average Orange County home price is $175,000, highest in the nation. It is no
wonder that the middle-class dream of owning a home is now out of reach for
most young Orange County families. I'm a case in point. Before moving we lived
in a two-bedroom apartment in Westminster for $610 a month. I accepted a job in
Denver. We moved into a brand new three-bedroom, two-story home. It includes a
yard, a full basement and a view of the mountains. We bought the house for
$110,000 at a 7.8% fixed, 30-year mortgage rate. A staffing manager who
recruits professional workers for my new company told me that the richest pool
of engineers is in Southern California -- it's easy to lure them away because
of the high cost of housing.

TRIPLE GOLD MEDALIST FROM PLACENTIA RATES AS ORANGE COUNTY'S TOP STORY

We want Janet.
</P>
<P>
We want Janet shampoo (She cleaned up at Seoul, now she wants to clean up your
scalp), we want Janet toothpaste (She'll do to your plaque what she did to the
East Germans) and we want Janet Cliff Notes (When gold medals get in the way of
The Great Gatsby). We want Janet-Jammies, we want JANET-LAND and yes, we want
our JTV.
</P>
<P>
We want Janet Evans in our newspapers and magazines, on our coffee tables and
television screens. We want Janet because she's the best, the brightest and
because she giggles after she wins Olympic gold medals, sets swimming world
records or eats pizza.
</P>
<P>
We want Janet Evans so badly that when she returned home to Placentia after
winning three gold medals (400-meter individual medley, 400- and 800-freestyle)
during the Seoul Summer Olympics, we practically chased her back to South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
Television cameras, still photographers, newspaper reporters, magazine writers,
TV personalities. And that was just Day 1. Taking in the crush of media-types
onto Placentia's El Dorado High School, where Evans is a senior and reigning
homecoming queen, classmate Shane Borowski said, "We all feel sorry for her. I
mean, look at that."
</P>
<P>
Evans claimed she wanted to be "Just Janet," but her commercial value has been
assessed in mega-bucks. Still, she's balked at signing professional
endorsements, choosing to search for a semblance of a normal life.
</P>
<P>
Good luck. At age 17, Janet Evans was Orange County's top sports story of 1988.
The 105-pound girl from Placentia was bigger than the play-dead Angels and
their amazing revolving managers (Mauch-to-Cookie-to-Moose-to-Rader).
</P>
<P>
Bigger than the Rams, whose Super Bowl hopes got as far as a wild-card game in
Minnesota. That's where they lost under climatic conditions usually reserved
for better shops and department stores.
</P>
<P>
She made a bigger splash than Lynne Cox, who swam a Russian lake in search of a
different kind of medal. (What's so funny about peace, love and understanding?)
She was a bigger hit than Angel catcher Bob Boone, who had his best year
batting and then bolted the Angels for the Kansas City Royals for just one
dollar more than he earned with the Angels in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Evans headed an amazing army of Orange County athletes under 21 years of age
who showed up their elders during the year. Placentia's Michael Chang, 16,
became the youngest male to win a singles match at Wimbledon and went on to
become, along with Andre Agassi, the next great hope for American tennis.
</P>
<P>
Placentia's Michele Granger, 18, now a freshman at California, was recognized
as the world's greatest softball pitcher, setting a dizzying array of national
softball pitching records while at Valencia High.
</P>
<P>
There was Servite High's Derek Brown, 17, who set the county single-season
rushing record and University of Houston running back Chuck Weatherspoon, 20, a
La Habra High alumnus who rushed for 1,005 yards and led the nation in yards
per carry (8.5).
</P>
<P>
There were Elaine Youngs (El Toro), Jenny Evans (Newport Harbor) and Laurie
Jones (Huntington Beach) who, as freshmen, played major roles on the UCLA
women's volleyball team that went 34-0 before losing in the semifinals of the
NCAA championships. Bob Hamelin, at age 20, batted .514 for Rancho Santiago
College and hit a state-record 31 home runs and 105 RBIs in 48 games.
</P>
<P>
The Mater Dei boys' basketball team won its fourth consecutive 5-A championship
despite recruiting allegations made against its athletic programs and the
team's failure to win the league title.
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar High, with an enrollment of only 1,400, won Southern Section
championships in girls' track, girls' tennis, water polo, football and a state
championship in boys' cross-country.
</P>
<P>
The Irvine High girls' volleyball team won its second straight state
championship.
</P>
<P>
The grownups' table -- filled with resignations, firings, disappointment and
guys named Moose -- did have some bright spots.
</P>
<P>
Greg Louganis of the Mission Viejo Nadadores became the first male to sweep
gold medals in diving in two Olympics. Newport Harbor's Greg Barton won two
gold medals in kayaking during the Summer Olympics, becoming the first American
to win a gold medal in singles kayaking. The Rams' Jim Everett set team
single-season records for pass completions, yards and touchdowns. Receiver
Henry Ellard set a season record for receptions. The Angels' Johnny Ray was an
All-Star.
</P>
<P>
But overall, it was the kids who were more than all right in 1988. And leading
the way were . . .
</P>
<P>
NOT JUST JANET ANYMORE
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Troup, director of U.S. Swimming Inc., had tested more than 1,000
swimmers for energy efficiency when he came across Janet Evans. After testing
her prior to the Summer Games, he proclaimed Evans the most energy efficient
"male or female" swimmer today.
</P>
<P>
"I'll stop short of saying Janet's a fish," said Troup, in a Sports Illustrated
article, "but physiologically she's very similar."
</P>
<P>
Whatever she was, she was like nothing most people had ever seen -- three gold
medals and one world record in events long dominated by women with thick
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
She tore through the Olympic pool with a slapping stroke that, above water,
looked like the last desperate plea of a drowning victim.
</P>
<P>
Experts told us what happens above the water doesn't matter, it's what happens
below, and below the water, they said, Janet Evans was perfect.
</P>
<P>
Three gold medals made that easy to figure. But what seemed to endear Evans to
the American public was what happened above the water: the block-long smile,
the giggles, the absolute absence of pretense.
</P>
<P>
She became insta-star, America's kid sister. Swimmer Matt Biondi won more gold
medals (5), sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner was more awesome to watch, Carl
Lewis and Greg Louganis might have proven themselves the nation's greatest
Olympians, but no American came back from Seoul more adored than Janet Evans.
</P>
<P>
She walked off a plane and in front of a television camera. Make that cameras.
Returning to Placentia, the Evans' family car passed under banners thanking
Janet, lawns drafting her ("Janet For Mayor," the placards read) and home to a
block party attended by 500 close friends, well-wishers, strangers, gawkers and
minicams.
</P>
<P>
Her first day back at school was no less hectic: battalions of reporters and
photographers descending upon El Dorado High.
</P>
<P>
She appeared with rich man, Johnny Carson of The Tonight Show, and Poorman, on
KROQ radio with deejay The Poorman, and received an invitation to the White
House from The Man.
</P>
<P>
She rode in the Disneyland Parade, the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade and was grand
marshal of the Placentia Heritage Days Parade.
</P>
<P>
Naively, she observed, "I've never come from a meet and had anything like this
happen."
</P>
<P>
Looking back with several months of perspective, she revised, "I guess I should
have realized that it was the Olympics."
</P>
<P>
She said that sitting in a hotel room in Phoenix, the day before she was to be
grand marshal of the Fiesta Day Parade. She has been the toast at banquets,
luncheons and award presentations. But she has refused to sign any endorsement
deals.
</P>
<P>
Though the media demand for her is much less frenzied, "it's died down a lot,"
it is still constant -- there are a couple national magazine covers planned for
her for early 1989. There are more than a few companies that would love to have
her on their side of the debit column. But no. One call to Biondi, who did sign
the endorsement deals, persuaded her.
</P>
<P>
"He told me he didn't have a home, that he just lived from hotel room to hotel
room, 'just going where they tell me to,' " Evans said. "We talked to them
(companies) and they said I could make a lot of money but it would be a
full-time job, that I would be so busy that I wouldn't be able to finish high
school.
</P>
<P>
"I know if I did it, I could be set for life, but finishing high school is very
important to me, so I said no."

And then she probably smiled.

<P>
THREE IN A FISHBOWL
</P>
<P>
Michael Chang stepped into 1988 already having the distinction of being the
youngest male tennis player to win the U.S. Tennis Assn. national 18-and-under
singles title and the youngest to win a singles match at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, at 16, he became the youngest to win a singles match at Wimbledon. He
advanced to the U.S. Open's fourth round this year before being eliminated by
the 18-year-old Agassi.
</P>
<P>
With the best tennis players in the world now residing in West Germany and
Sweden, Chang and Agassi's coming of age signaled hope for American men's
tennis, which has been mired in post-Jimbo/Big Mac depression.
</P>
<P>
Like Agassi, Chang hits the ball with amazing velocity and moves his body just
about as fast. Pancho Segura compared him to a young Ken Rosewall.
</P>
<P>
France's Henry LeConte succinctly summed up Chang's past, present and future
when he said, "He moves so quickly with such good timing. I'm thinking,
'Sixteen years old?' God."
</P>
<P>
Michele Granger did everything in 1988 to confirm that she is the best softball
pitcher in the world. She ended her high school career at Valencia holding
national records for single-season strikeouts, career strikeouts, career
no-hitters and tied the mark for single-season no-hitters.
</P>
<P>
But while she has won numerous national and international titles -- including a
gold medal during the 1987 Pan American Games -- she failed to win a Southern
Section championship in her 4 years at Valencia High. Her high school career
came to a bizarre end during a 25-inning, 3-A semifinal game against La Mirada
that took 2 days to play.
</P>
<P>
Valencia had 10 hits in the game but failed to score. The Tigers also made 9
errors, 3 of which led to La Mirada's 1 run and the victory. Granger struck out
40 in the game and afterward, in, perhaps, 1988's greatest overstatement said,
"I let my team down."
</P>
<P>
Derek Brown came into 1988 having performed well in 2 varsity seasons as the
starting tailback for arguably Orange County's highest-profile football program
-- Servite High in Anaheim. But he played in the long shadow cast by Crespi
High's Russell White, who came into this year a two-time winner of the
large-school division's most valuable player award.
</P>
<P>
White began the season with the publicity, but Brown eventually made the season
his own. In a memorable October meeting between the two backs, Brown outgained
White 312 yards to 81 as Servite won the game 35-20.
</P>
<P>
Brown went on to lead the Southern Section in rushing and set an Orange County
single-season rushing record with 2,301 yards. He and Fountain Valley
quarterback David Henigan were named co-Division 1 most valuable players.
</P>
<P>
When it was clear that Brown was having a better season than White, the Crespi
back quipped, "He better remember who was the originator and who is the
imitator."
</P>
<P>
By year's end, Derek Brown and the rest of Orange County's kid wonders made
certain they'd be remembered for quite a while.

STOCK WATCH: SOME COMPANIES HIT HARDEST BY CRASH PICKED UP THE PIECES, CAME OUT
AHEAD
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SCHINE, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Friday, the last trading day of 1988, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
briefly climbed above the level it had enjoyed before the October, 1987, market
collapse. It was a fitting end to a year that proved stronger than expected,
with the Dow increasing 12%.
</P>
<P>
It was equally fitting that the best performing Orange County stocks of 1988
were among those hardest hit by the crash.
</P>
<P>
Orange County's star performers managed to rescue themselves from the rubble to
either approach or surpass their pre-crash highs. In most cases, analysts said,
they are solid companies that enjoyed healthy returns.
</P>
<P>
ICN Biomedicals, a Costa Mesa medical instruments and chemicals company, led
the pack on a percentage basis. The stock rose 331%, starting the year at $3.25
and finishing at $14.
</P>
<P>
For the first 9 months of its current fiscal year, ICN Biomedicals has enjoyed
a 35% increase in earnings. Its third-quarter performance was even stronger,
with profits up 59%.
</P>
<P>
Gradco Corp., an Irvine manufacturer of office copier and printer products,
placed second, appreciating 126% for the year. Gradco stock, which began the
year at $5.875, closed at $13.25.
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year ended March, 1988, Gradco reported net income of $4.1
million on sales of $90.9 million, and the company continued to post strong
numbers over the latter part of the year.
</P>
<P>
During the past 12 months, most investors steered clear of small companies.
Many had been burned badly by the crash.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the smaller Orange County companies are not very liquid, and they
just got hammered in the crash, as people fell over themselves to get out of
them," said Larry Selwitz, director of research at Cruttenden &amp; Co., a
Newport Beach brokerage.
</P>
<P>
Many investors who got back into the market in 1988 initially chose to buy
stocks in larger, more established companies.
</P>
<P>
But as the year wore on and many Orange County companies began to report strong
earnings, investors started funneling money into such companies as ICN
Biomedicals, Ropak and Gradco.
</P>
<P>
"The stock of some of these companies had become so oversold that people
realized these prices offered unusually good value," Selwitz said. "It was an
opportunity for people to make a lot of money."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the county's biggest market losers generally reflected unspectacular
corporate performance.
</P>
<P>
Resdel Industries, a Newport Beach electronics firm, lost the most ground in
1988. Its stock began the year at $5.25 a share and crashed to $1.4375, a 73%
decline.
</P>
<P>
The company posted an $8.3-million loss for the year ended June 30 and
disclosed in October that it had laid off 130 people, or more than a third of
its work force. The firm's problems were attributed primarily to unsuccessful
efforts to expand through acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
Another bomb was Diceon Electronics, which began the year trading at $30.50 but
declined to $12.50 at year end, losing 59% of its value.
</P>
<P>
Diceon had sales of $147 million and earned $9.8 million in the fiscal year
ended in September. But most of its profits were realized in the first 6 months
of the year, while the second half was a dud. Analysts are projecting that the
company will have flat earnings for the first half of 1989.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Diceon, which for several years has been one of Orange County's
top performing growth companies, was snubbed by analysts and investors.
</P>
<P>
Preston Athey, a growth fund manager for T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, said he
continues to hold Diceon and several other Orange County stocks because of what
he believes are bright prospects for small growth companies in 1989.
</P>
<P>
T. Rowe Price has about $1.3 billion invested in emerging growth funds. The
investment firm's Orange County holdings include National Education of Irvine,
Silicon Systems of Tustin and Archive Corp.
</P>
<P>
Athey said a statistical indicator used by T. Rowe Price recently signaled that
many, small growth companies "are grossly undervalued" relative to historic
norms.
</P>
<P>
"If the past is any indication, 1989 is the year that these stocks will do very
well relative to the rest of the market," Athey said.
</P>
<P>
He said he is particularly bullish about small growth companies because many
economists and analysts are projecting that their earnings growth will outpace
larger companies in 1989.

COUNTY'S PLAN IS GARBAGE;
</P>
<P>
TRASH DISPOSAL: IF SOMETHING ISN'T DONE QUICKLY, LOS ANGELES CITY RESIDENTS
WILL END UP MAKING UNJUSTIFIED CONCESSIONS.
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO COSBY-ROSSMANN, Antonio Cosby-Rossmann, an attorney and lecturer at
Stanford Law School, has represented citizens of the City of Los Angeles in the
garbage wars since 1973.
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The County of Los Angeles, which has historically embraced some of the nation's
sharpest land swindles, is out to break new ground in its legacy of shady
real-estate deals.
</P>
<P>
Purportedly acting to provide a badly needed garbage facility, the Board of
Supervisors has secretly approved a plan that will enrich the county
bureaucracy and a high-powered developer at the expense of Los Angeles city
taxpayers and Santa Monica Mountains park users. Because the City Council
tentatively approved the plan with little public notice or review, aggressive
citizen action is needed to keep it from becoming reality.
</P>
<P>
The supervisors' plan begins with a worthy enough goal: to construct a readily
accessible, environmentally sound garbage-disposal facility that can meet
countywide needs for half a century. The location, Elsmere Canyon, lies in the
San Gabriel Mountains just north of the city-county line and along the Antelope
Valley Freeway. Virtually all the experts agree that Elsmere is the appropriate
place for the county's major disposal facility.
</P>
<P>
Rather than seize with principle this opportunity to meet public needs, the
supervisors' program threatens establishment of the dump by attaching illegal
and unwise conditions to Elsmere's use by all county residents. Like an
entrepreneur in control of a hot property, the county sees Elsmere as an
opportunity to maximize profits, broaden its options for future trash disposal
and realize revenge against an old adversary, the city. Taking advantage of its
public power to condemn the Elsmere land, the county seeks to extort
unjustified concessions from city residents.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the supervisors demand as a condition of dumping Los Angeles
city garbage in Elsmere Canyon:
</P>
<P>
 -- That dumping in Lopez Canyon be expanded and continued until 1996, even
though the site violates state standards;
</P>
<P>
 -- That dumping in Sunshine Canyon also be expanded, even though the operation
violates a 25-year-old city permit;
</P>
<P>
 -- That the city pay an extra "tribute" of at least $1 dollar a ton for
dumping at Elsmere that can be increased at the sole discretion of the county
and its Sanitation District;
</P>
<P>
 -- That Rustic and Sullivan canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains be sold at
market value, rather than released to park agencies at acquisition costs, as
state law requires. (The sites are no longer suitable for dumping but held in
trust by the county Sanitation District for public recreation.)
</P>
<P>
 -- That Mission Canyon, county-owned under the same trusteeship as Rustic and
Sullivan canyons, not be released for recreational use but be sold to developer
Ray Watt, providing necessary access to his ambitious and adjacent development.

<P>
Extortion of the city is the only glue holding together the Elsmere plan.
County supervisors have been angry ever since the city closed the county's
Mission Canyon garbage site in 1981. The city used its land-use authority to
end dumping at the facility, located within city limits, citing harm done to
surrounding neighbors. In response, the county has prohibited the city from
dumping garbage at county sites open to other municipalities.
</P>
<P>
This policy of blackmail, designed to force the city to place new garbage dumps
within its borders, regardless of the environmental consequences, did not work
so long as existing city facilities had not reached capacity. But with Lopez
and Sunshine canyons nearing their limits, the extortion becomes more
effective.
</P>
<P>
Alternative solutions exist that would create a garbage facility for all county
residents, expand recreational opportunities in the Santa Monica Mountains and
end existing conflicts over garbage dumping next to established neighborhoods:
</P>
<P>
 -- The Elsmere facility, designed to prevent harm to existing neighbors,
should be established as soon as possible;
</P>
<P>
 -- Elsmere should be open at uniform fees to all residents;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 -- Garbage dumping in Lopez and Sunshine canyons should terminate when current
permits expire;
</P>
<P>
 -- Rustic, Sullivan and Mission canyons should be transferred to the Santa
Monica Mountains Conservancy for recreation at acquisition cost;
</P>
<P>
 -- Elsmere's uniform disposal fees should be used to reimburse the county and
its Sanitation District for the transfer of the canyons, because all county
residents will benefit from this new parkland;
</P>
<P>
 -- The state attorney general should immediately prosecute county officials
who maintain the policy of extortion.
</P>
<P>
Now that the county's secretly formulated plan has been exposed, citizens and
their representatives at City Hall can force a publicly acceptable substitute.
As shown by its vote last month to require separation of household trash, the
City Council can make sound policy. Los Angeles citizens and their council must
undo the county's attempted swindle of public resources.

ROMANIAN REBUILDING

<TEXT>
<P>
The deaths of thousands of people in Timisoara and Bucharest were not in vain.
The extent of the tyranny that ruled Romania is beyond belief.
</P>
<P>
For such a monstrosity to be overcome so fast is in itself a miracle.
</P>
<P>
The battle is hardly over; although the cancerous core of the leadership is
gone, the weight of the past must be now reshaped into a future. This could be
the first time in recent history that America and the Soviet Union cooperate in
the rebuilding of a shattered state and economy.
</P>
<P>
Romania needs all the help we can offer: Advisers from a mutual pool of
human/technological resources provided through the United Nations and other
international bodies. An unprecedented opportunity is now presenting itself; a
global shift towards increased cooperation between the East and West on many
levels previously thought impossible.
</P>
<P>
The bloody failure of the police state run by Ceausescu could have become a
drawn-out civil war. Instead, it seems to be headed in a positive direction.
</P>
<P>
We can help Romania and Eastern Europe rebuild their economies, and work
together towards a positive future. There are astounding implications for world
peace and commerce, two faces of the same dream.

LEGALIZING ILLICIT DRUGS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three cheers for Rep. George W. Crockett (D-Mich.), columnist William F.
Buckley, former Secretary of State George Schultz, U.S. District Judge Robert
Sweet and Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke. While countless other public officials
exploit the drug problem for personal political advantage, they have
unselfishly championed the only rational, effective alternative to the
currently disastrous situation: legalization.
</P>
<P>
Supply does not create demand. Demand creates supply. We can spend any amount
of money trying to intercept substances. We can impose any penalty on the
dealers and users. We can completely erode the civil rights of our citizens.
But as long as someone is willing to pay for a commodity, someone will be
willing to supply that commodity; and the more risk the suppliers assume, the
greater their profits will be. This is basic economics, simple human nature and
can not be altered by legislation.
</P>
<P>
What we can do is eliminate international drug lords, terrorism, corruption and
criminal empires by taking the profit out of the equation. By shattering their
market, we can literally shut down these drug mafias overnight.
</P>
<P>
We can also redirect our efforts and resources toward diminishing the demand
for drugs by accurately publicizing the health risks inherent to the user.
Former Surgeon General Koop has demonstrated that the public can be positively
influenced in terms of substance abuse. And he didn't require a $9 billion
budget to do it.
</P>
<P>
By initiating serious discussion of the decriminalization issue, Messrs.
Crockett, Buckley, Schultz, Sweet and Schmoke have done far more to protect our
youth from the drug problem than all the rest of the "drug warriors" combined.

Surprise. Domestic auto sales are in a slump.
</P>
<P>
I submit a partial list of possible reasons why:
</P>
<P>
My 1985 Dodge Shelby Charger has had the brakes fail, the alternator fail, the
timing belt fail, the computer fail, the headlights fail, the fuel system fail,
the radio fail, the tachometer fail, the cooling system fail, the
air-conditioning system fail, the battery fail (twice), the hatch lifters fail
and the paint fail.
</P>
<P>
Then there is the turbo, lurking under the hood for the warranty to expire amid
a flurry of repair dollars.
</P>
<P>
Is there any question why the American public is giving pause before purchasing
a domestic automobile that is (1) overpriced to start with, (2) unreliable and
will need inevitable/expensive repair of even basic systems and (3) will lose
resale value faster than back issues of Proctology Digest?

LEGALIZING ILLICIT DRUGS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Kunstler (Op-Ed, Dec. 15, "Why Not Sell at the Local Pharmacy?")
continues the cry for drug legalization. Typically he raises the specter of
violence, illicit profits, etc. and reaches the perfectly logical conclusion
that prohibition doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
Certainly, no thinking person would disagree with him. He fails, however, to
point out that legalization (of alcohol, caffeine and nicotine) is hardly a
howling success.
</P>
<P>
Since our society has been so unsuccessful in "educating and treating" the
current crop of boozers, smokers and coffee drinkers, what in the world makes
Kunstler and all the rest think that, once legalized, the control of the much
more addictive and psychoactive substances such as cocaine, marijuana and
heroin will be so simple?

POP GOES THE REFUND
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pennies will be closer to nickels today for thrifty consumers who recycle their
empty soda and beer containers. A new state law will boost the ineffective
one-cent refund to a nickel for two small cans or one large bottle.
</P>
<P>
The higher refunds will make recycling a little more rewarding.
</P>
<P>
Californians have bothered to return barely half of their empties to recycling
depots at nearby supermarkets or to a state-certified recycling centers since
the bottle law took effect just over two years ago. Even environmentally minded
consumers have argued that a penny back wasn't worth the trouble.
</P>
<P>
The stronger incentive takes effect today. An empty two-liter bottle, glass or
plastic, is worth five cents. Also, worth a nickel are two cans or bottles that
contain less than 24 ounces. Five cents, the standard reward in states that
have successful bottle laws, ought to prove persuasive.
</P>
<P>
Californians drink 12 billion bottles and cans of soda or beer in a typical
year. The empties choke landfills -- and that's when the cans and bottles are
properly disposed. Many are just tossed away by litterbugs, blighting beaches,
parks and roads. Maybe a nickel will change their bad habits.
</P>
<P>
Recycling can take some pressure off the distressed environment. Consumers who
take the time to return their empties deserve their reward.

TRIBUTE TO A WAR HERO
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not too long ago many Americans believed marijuana was no more harmful than
tobacco, and a presidential adviser described cocaine as "probably the most
benign of illicit drugs currently in widespread use . . ." Back then, police
officers fought a dangerous, lonely and unappreciated war against drugs. Los
Angeles Police Officer Kelly Key was one of its troopers.
</P>
<P>
He was paralyzed nearly two decades ago by a bullet fired while he tried to
serve a search warrant on a suspected cocaine dealer. Key died last week,
having spent the rest of his life in a wheelchair from which he taught
youngsters the dangers of drugs and other temptations of the streets.
</P>
<P>
A quadriplegic, he still volunteered three days a week at the Gwen Bolden
Foundation, an after-school counseling program in a rough neighborhood south of
downtown Los Angeles. Key was a tutor and a mentor, often for boys with no
other man in their lives. He bought book-packs, shoes and treated youngsters to
lunch, which was for many their first experience in a restaurant. He quietly
did things to teach youngsters to feel good about themselves. There was no
better role model in the war against drugs.
</P>
<P>
Drug use has exploded exponentially since a bullet cut short Key's once-bright
police career in 1970. Now it destroys lives, families and communities
wholesale. As the terror of the nightmare grows, more officers like Key risk
their lives. But, as law enforcement leaders are beginning to recognize, the
war must be waged with equal fervor against the underlying social causes that
make illicit drugs so alluring for so many. Prevention must be as important as
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Kelly Key, who turned 49 the day before he died, will be buried Tuesday with
full Police Department honors. His tombstone should read: Pioneer and Hero in
the War Against Drugs.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: TEACH YOUNGSTERS TO PROFIT FROM SETBACKS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: How can I help build my children's self-esteem and make them
able to succeed in a tough world? I don't want them to be insensitive, but I
don't want them to wilt every time something difficult comes along. My wife and
I aren't wealthy, so they're going to have to make it on their own. -- T.S.
</P>
<P>
DEAR T.S.: The fact that you're aware that youngsters need to be able to cope
with frustration and disappointment is already a plus. Children need to learn
how to cope with defeat and parents need to explain that we all learn from our
failures. If a child doesn't know this, he may limit himself by trying only
those tasks he knows he can do well.
</P>
<P>
When things go wrong, when your youngster gets a disappointing grade or when he
fails on a test, help him not to be overcome by these setbacks. Remind him that
they are temporary and that he can learn from his past errors and do better
next time.
</P>
<P>
Michael Scheier, a psychologist at Carnegie-Mellon University, found that
optimists handle stress better than pessimists. Optimists tend to respond to
disappointments by formulating a plan of action and asking other people for
help and advice while pessimists are likely to react to the same difficulties
by trying to forget the whole thing or by assuming there's nothing they can do
to change things.
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I'm engaged to a wonderful woman but I'm troubled by what
happens to her when she drinks. First of all, she doesn't seem to know when to
stop, and when I mention this the next day, she gets defensive, assuring me
that she can stop whenever she wants. I know that after we've been celebrating
at a party, she doesn't remember things that have happened the night before.
This is important because she frequently behaves badly. How can I handle this
and should I insist that she go on the wagon? -- F.T.
</P>
<P>
DEAR F.T.: I doubt that you'd accomplish much if you simply "insisted" that she
go on the wagon. She's showing symptoms of alcoholism, such as personality
changes when she drinks, denial about her drinking patterns and blackouts or
memory lapses. While some non-alcoholics do occasionally experience these same
symptoms, it's unusual and is a strong indication that there are serious
drinking problems.
</P>
<P>
There are ways to spot future alcoholics, such as the need to find constant
excuses for a drink, and the pattern of having every occasion -- sad or happy
-- begin and end with a drink. Another clue that you seem to be getting is the
inability of your friend to stop drinking or to refuse alcohol once she's
started.
</P>
<P>
Try to get her to some meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous. If she refuses, I'd
postpone plans for marriage until she reconsiders.

GRIM TALES INHABIT SPECIAL DARK REALITY

<TEXT>
<P>
A Place of Light by Mary Bush (Morrow: $16.95; 258 pps.)
</P>
<P>
"I had four sisters in my life, but Maude is the only one alive," a boy in his
teens tells us in one of these stories. That's because his mother has the nasty
habit of killing off her babies when they cry too much. All of the short
stories in this sober, brilliant collection are set in rural, poverty-stricken,
Upstate New York -- deserted backwaters where there are no jobs. The land is
played out; the smart, enterprising people have left, and the collective gene
pool is something you wouldn't want to dive into.
</P>
<P>
What are "we" -- and, by that pronoun, I mean the educated, the orderly, even
the "enlightened" readers scanning this review right now -- to make of stories
like these?
</P>
<P>
My feeling is that having lived through the so-called "holiday" season, many of
us have had to notice once again that human emotions are often irrational and
base; that maybe 50% of all parents wish devoutly that they'd never had their
children; maybe 75% of all children -- even in these "enlightened" times --
grow up in terror of their parents, and, if they live long enough, are able to
turn the tables on those creatures who have been so penurious with their
affection and so prodigal with their insults and their dreadful threats, their
pledges of undying hatred. The child has no recourse but to live long enough,
stick around and make his or her abusive parents miserable and afraid!
Something to live for, in these trying times.
</P>
<P>
This collection deals with several levels of terror that (perhaps all) children
have to deal with at one level or another. "Underground Railroad," with its
baby-slaughtering mother, is only the most extreme example here. Some of these
tales seem comparatively innocuous: "Muskrat" and "Rude Awakening" are both
gender-oriented, coming-of-age stories: In the former, two small boys set out
to trap muskrat and end up with something large and alive that isn't a muskrat,
already suffering terribly from the cramped iron trap on its leg. Too fearful
to let it loose, too fearful to admit their fear, the boys finally suffocate
the animal by burying it alive in stones.
</P>
<P>
Harmless, maybe, "Boys will be boys," and all that, but this stolid
indifference to suffering comes back to haunt the reader in another story as
two adult hunters carelessly terrorize a young couple in the woods. In "Rude
Awakening" a young girl, cordially detested by her mother, is forced to put
aside her overalls and don a white veil for her First Communion. She gets sick,
and after long and horrible minutes, finally spits out the Host. Again, no harm
is done, all little girls get sick, but her alienation from her family, her
sense of being totally alone in the world, is confirmed forever.
</P>
<P>
Some of these stories emerge from poverty, so that, if we own a microwave and
an automatic coffee pot, or are saving our money in CDs, we may be able to
persuade ourselves that they are not our stories. In "Difficult Passage," a
little girl wheels her legless grandpa to the circus to see freaks, realizing
in the process that the poverty-stricken people in her own town are not just
the audience, but freaks as well.
</P>
<P>
In two separate stories, incest (or plain child molestation), may be blamed on
unemployment: If Uncle JoJo in "Outlaws" or the repellent Robert in "A Place of
Light" had decent jobs, perhaps they wouldn't spend their waking hours trying
to have sex with small girls. But I don't believe money fixes everything, and
neither does the author. In two stories, unexpectedly, sanctuaries appear, out
in grim woods, where, people manage to live in harmony with their surroundings
and with self-respect. Just seeing these places, these people, heartens other
characters, trapped in their own misery. Maybe it is possible to live another
way, in a decent way.
</P>
<P>
Always, with stories like this, there is that lame editorial attempt at
distancing. In a downright pitiful blurb of this book, someone writes, ". . .
Harsh lives make for compelling drama." Maybe. But I have a feeling the world
is made up of those who know these stories are reality, and others, who peek
into these pages, play dumb and say "Yum yum! Look at all these harsh lives and
all this compelling drama!"
</P>
<P>
Those who know this grim reality will take these stories straight to their sad
hearts: "Not one other family looked like theirs," one lost little girl thinks.
"No one was making a scene. No one else was miserable." But a lot of other
people -- even with Dad hauling in the bucks and Mom wearing a giant gold
necklace -- are starving, right now, for love. Or, dry as a bone, they know
themselves unable to give that love. That's not "compelling drama." That's
reality. Mary Bush reminds all of us that, paradoxically, in our terrible
isolation, we're not alone.

THE ECCENTRIC BUDDHIST VISION OF ITO JAKUCHU, GREENGROCER AND ARTIST
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An exhibition of Japanese paintings that caused a stir last fall in New York
recently arrived at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. "The Paintings of
Jakuchu," which features an astonishing range of works by one of 18th-Century
Japan's authentically great individualists, is certain to captivate aficionados
as well as visitors who just wander into the museum.
</P>
<P>
Jakuchu's colorfully painted scrolls depicting flora and fauna are so profusely
detailed and brilliantly designed that they defy imagining how any mere human
being could have created them. At the opposite extreme is his breathtakingly
minimal series of six ink-on-paper scrolls called "Lotus Pond." The quiet scene
melts away into a central space that appears to be empty but is actually filled
with the specter of death and winter.
</P>
<P>
Between these two poles of Jakuchu's sensibility are relatively crude paintings
of clay dolls, striking woodblock prints of bright birds on velvety black
backgrounds and -- seriously -- a funeral scene portraying the dead Buddha as a
radish surrounded by mourning vegetables.
</P>
<P>
There's a certain logic to "Vegetable Parinirvana," the improbable and
apparently irreverent death scene. Ito Jakuchu (1716-1800) was the son of a
greengrocer and ran the family's wholesale business for 17 years before he
became a full-time artist at 40. He may have been more at home with the
mushrooms, persimmons, yams and cucumbers in his parody than with human
characters. An assiduous observer of nature, Jakuchu also raised chickens and
elevated them to lofty heights of grace and beauty in his paintings.
</P>
<P>
Environment may account for some of his subject matter, but there's no
explaining the innovative talent and brilliant eccentricity that has
distinguished Jakuchu in the annals of Japanese painting. A born artist, he was
ill-suited to business and eventually unloaded that burden on a younger
brother. Jakuchu had classical training in Japanese painting and drew
inspiration from Chinese painters, but he developed such an unusual style that
he stands out as an eccentric.
</P>
<P>
One wonders how he got away with it, but in fact he was highly regarded during
his life. Jakuchu had the good fortune to live in Kyoto during a peaceful time
when a spirit of experimentation and individuality was in vogue.
</P>
<P>
He initially gained fame for his masterpiece -- a series of 30 vividly painted
scrolls known as the "Colorful Realm of Living Beings." Painted from about 1757
to 1765, the scrolls are a pictorial encyclopedia of plants and animals
interpreted according to Jakuchu's vision of peace and prosperity. He presented
the scrolls in 1765 to Shokukuji, a Zen temple in Kyoto. They are part of the
Imperial Household Collection and are rarely put on public exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Examples currently on display in Los Angeles are panels called "Mandarin Ducks
in Snow," "Hydrangeas and Fowl," "Fish in a Lotus Pond," "Golden Pheasants in
Snow" and "Birds and Peonies." All are poetic marriages of flora and fauna, so
closely entwined that they seem to be of a piece. Striking in composition --
characterized by sweeping curves and rhythmic repetition -- the scrolls are
skillfully detailed down to the last detail of the last feather.
</P>
<P>
These color paintings represent one major component of Jakuchu's work. The
other is ink paintings that reveal the artist's devotion to Zen. Strictly
speaking, however, the ink paintings do not conform to Zen principles. Despite
their enormous energy and directness, they are more calculated, less
spontaneous in feeling than classical Zen works.
</P>
<P>
Jakuchu was a lay Zen priest, so his affinity to the philosophy's artistic
precepts are expected. But he was also such an individualist that he inevitably
came up with his own style. It is typified by such ink paintings as "Two
Roosters and a Hen" and "Pine, Plum and Crane," which contrast dramatic shapes
and patterns with open space.
</P>
<P>
About 45 works, on loan from Japanese collections, are on view on the lower
floor of the Ahmanson Building, but they are only the beginning of a
three-course Jakuchu banquet. Because of Japanese government regulations and
the fragility of the works, "The Paintings of Jakuchu" is being presented in
two parts. Part I continues through Jan. 14. Part II will be shown from Jan. 18
to Feb. 18. Each portion contains a full chronological range of the artist's
work, so that visitors who only see one part can grasp the whole of his oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
The third course of the banquet is an auxiliary exhibition (to Feb. 18) in the
Japanese Pavilion. "The Colorful Realm of Jakuchu and Jakuen" consists of works
by the master and his most prominent student, Jakuen, from American
collections. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Denver Art Museum
and four private collectors have loaned pieces that complement the County
Museum of Art's extensive Jakuchu collection.

Talk Show Host Gets Death Threat: A radio talk show host in Greenville, S.C.,
said he has received a death threat invoking the name of a Denver radio
personality whose murder was linked to white supremacists. Mike Gallagher,
whose talk show on WFBC-AM airs from 9 a.m. until noon, said he had just
finished a program on racism on Thursday when he received a telephone call from
a man who identified himself only as "George from Anderson," a South Carolina
town.
</P>
<P>
Gallagher said the caller told him to "remember Alan Berg," the Denver talk
show host who was gunned down in 1984. When Gallagher left the station around 2
p.m., he found a note on his car windshield that included a racial remark,
another reference to Berg and the words, "You're a dead man." The threat, which
is being investigated by police, came after Gallagher and his callers discussed
the controversy over a South Carolina sheriff accused of using a racial slur.

Beckett Tribute to Air: A three-hour tribute to dramatist Samuel Beckett will
air at noon today on KCRW-FM (89.9). The program will present four of Beckett's
plays -- "All That Fall," starring Jack Albertson; "Embers," starring Leonard
Nimoy; "Cascando" and "Rough for Radio II" -- all of which Beckett wrote for
the radio. The Nobel Prize-winning author, who is perhaps best known for the
play "Waiting for Godot," died Dec. 22 at age 83. SHAUNA SNOW

The Bride Wore Black: Jeff Clayton, 26-year-old lead singer with the punk rock
band Anti-Seen, exchanged wedding vows Saturday with 20-year-old Dee Dazis in a
Charlotte, N.C., nightclub.
</P>
<P>
The bride wore black, as did almost all the guests. The best man was a woman
and the flower girl was a grown man. Clayton and his bride promised "to love
and obey, to have and to hold, to rock 'n' roll until death do us part." As
soon as the vows were pronounced, Clayton left his bride at the bar and
performed songs from Anti-Seen's latest album, "Noise for the Sake of Noise."
Observed one guest: "Rock 'n' roll is, like, forever." SHAUNA SNOW

PAYCHECKS TO MEDICARE -- NEW FEDERAL LAWS TAKE EFFECT
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new year ushers in an array of federal laws and regulations affecting
everything from the size of Americans' paychecks to the operation of the Panama
Canal.
</P>
<P>
During the first week of 1990, Social Security taxes and benefits will go up,
Medicare coverage will be cut back because of the repeal of catastrophic
illness insurance and the canal will get a Panamanian administrator.
</P>
<P>
Long-term programs will be started Jan. 1 to control Medicare payments to
doctors, close military bases, prevent an accidental clash between U.S. and
Soviet forces and set up new task forces to fight organized crime.
</P>
<P>
The new laws and regulations include:
</P>
<P>
Social Security -- Automatic 4.7% cost-of-living increases start for 39 million
Social Security and Supplemental Security Income recipients. Average monthly
benefits rise from $541 to $566 for Social Security and from $368 to $386 under
SSI.
</P>
<P>
The total Social Security tax rate rises from 7.51% to 7.65% and the maximum
earnings subject to the tax will be go up from $48,000 to $51,300. The maximum
tax bite will rise from $3,604.80 to $3,924.45.
</P>
<P>
The amount of money Social Security recipients can earn without a reduction in
benefits increases from $8,880 to $9,360 for those between ages 65 and 69 and
from $6,480 to $6,840 for those under 65.
</P>
<P>
Panama Canal -- Under the 1979 Panama Canal Act, the U.S. administrator, Dennis
McAuliffe, steps down and turns over day-to-day control of the waterway to a
Panamanian, who reports to the U.S.-dominated canal commission.
</P>
<P>
Until the administrator nominated by the new government of Panama is approved
by President Bush and the Senate, the deputy administrator, Fernando Manfredo,
a Panamanian, will be acting administrator. Panama takes over the Canal on Dec.
31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Medicare -- Because of the repeal of the Catastrophic Coverage Act, 32.6
million senior citizens lose some hospitalization, skilled nursing and hospice
benefits.
</P>
<P>
In one major change, seniors face paying a hospital deductible for each 90-day
benefit period and daily $148 co-payments after the 60th day. Under the old
law, the elderly received 365 days of hospitalization for one deductible.
</P>
<P>
Because of a computer glitch, the monthly supplemental catastrophic coverage
premium will be deducted from Social Security checks and then refunded for
several months.
</P>
<P>
The hospital deductible automatically increases from $560 to $592 to cover
rising costs. The monthly Part B premium, covering doctor fees, rises from
$27.90 to $28.60. But because seniors no longer owe a supplemental premium,
Part B costs actually will be lower.
</P>
<P>
The program to control the growth in Medicare payments to doctors and to shift
spending from specialized procedures begins. In 1990, a 9.1% rise in costs has
been targeted, contrasted with recent increases of 16%.
</P>
<P>
National Security -- The military begins a program to close 86 bases by 1995.
The cost-saving plan was drafted by a commission created by Congress and took
effect when congressional opponents failed to muster enough votes to kill it in
April.
</P>
<P>
Communications between the United States and the Soviet Union will be improved
to prevent accidental conflict.
</P>
<P>
Taxes -- Farm workers subject to Social Security withholding will be subject to
income tax withholding.
</P>
<P>
The excise tax paid by passengers on international flights from the United
States increases from $3 to $6.
</P>
<P>
A new excise tax of $3 will be charged each passenger on some ocean voyages.
</P>
<P>
An excise tax of 5 cents a barrel will be levied on crude oil and imported
petroleum products to create a trust fund to clean up oil spills.
</P>
<P>
An excise tax on ozone-depleting chemicals will take effect.
</P>
<P>
Tax preparers who fail to sign a return or fail to include a taxpayer
identification number will face new penalties.
</P>
<P>
Loan Programs -- The Veterans Affairs Department will guarantee up to $46,000
of a home loan for a veteran or a survivor, up from $36,000.
</P>
<P>
Schools whose students have fault rate of 30% or more will be excluded from the
program.
</P>
<P>
Miscellaneous -- Organized crime task forces will be set up in each of the 23
U.S. attorney's offices, replacing autonomous task forces.

BEHIND PASADENA'S ROSE-COLORED GLASSES, A CITY OF DIVERSITY;
</P>
<P>
PARADE: COLORFUL FLOATS AND SPIRITED BANDS WILL TAKE A TOUR OF THE CITY'S HIGH
AND LOW POINTS.
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There is a popular theory that views the Tournament of Roses as a prime reason
-- the prime reason -- for the population explosion in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
Every year on New Year's Day, millions of shivering Easterners and
Midwesterners tune their television sets to the festivities in Pasadena. What
they see is a compelling small-screen vision of balmy revelry, complete with
suntanned princesses, football players in short sleeves, swirls of flowers and
sun-dappled mountains. Then, migrating like lemmings, dazzled television
viewers join the westward march.
</P>
<P>
So goes the theory.
</P>
<P>
For a century, Pasadenans have treasured that vision of their city as a place
where dreams come true and the weather's fine any time of year.
</P>
<P>
But behind the image of civilized hoopla is a complicated city of 132,000,
struggling fitfully to reconcile its diverse elements. These days, the
once-idyllic community -- which seems to stretch across the map of the western
San Gabriel Valley like a child's bib -- has gangs, drugs, smog and a running
debate on development. But it also can boast of visionary entrepreneurship,
socially concerned city leaders, impressive arts and educational institutions
and -- especially during the holiday season -- a spirit of optimism.
</P>
<P>
"The Tournament focuses international attention on the city," said Pasadena
Mayor William Thomson, "but it's also a time of celebration within the city. We
tend to put aside our troubles and differences and focus on the good things in
our lives."
</P>
<P>
The Rose Parade, which began 101 years ago as a horse-and-buggy romp through
wrestern Pasadena, now cuts through the geographical and economic heart of the
city. For discerning Pasadenans, the 5.5-mile parade route represents a brief
tour of the city's high points and low points.
</P>
<P>
It begins, fittingly, on Orange Grove Boulevard, where the city itself began in
the late 19th Century. The parade starts out from the heart of well-to-do
Pasadena, in a palmy section south of the Rose Bowl called "Millionaire's Row."
</P>
<P>
By 8:10 a.m. today, when the Riverside Community College Marching Tigers Band
leads the parade down the boulevard, the neighborhood will be crammed with
floats and marchers.
</P>
<P>
For well-heeled residents, this is something between a nuisance and a blessing.
"You sort of can't live with it and you can't live without it," said Ken
Grobecker, who grumbles good-naturedly about the parade goers who jam the west
Pasadena neighborhood each year.
</P>
<P>
The parade moves out slowly, passing the sprawling Norton Simon Museum of Art,
then moving into Old Pasadena, the city's commercial district.
</P>
<P>
Old Pasadena is where city planners like to tout their city's spirit of
creativity. In less than 10 years, the area has gone from Skid Row to "Westwood
East." Buildings that once moldered in disuse now house a Cajun restaurant, a
fitness club, an espresso bar and a disco. More than 120 new businesses have
opened there since 1980.
</P>
<P>
Doug Brignole was one of the pioneers. He bought an 80-year-old DeLacey Avenue
stable in 1985 and turned it into a prosperous health club.
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is overjoyed about the crowds of young urban professionals surging
from shop to shop.
</P>
<P>
"It has a shiny new coat of paint, but, yeah, it's lost something," said Paul
Elliott, a former Art Center College of Design student.
</P>
<P>
"My favorite place was a bar called Hazel's," he said, "where the old-timers
used to sit at the bar and drink straight shots of whiskey. . . . Now I see
they've built a Benetton's where the Salvation Army used to be. That's the end
of any neighborhood."
</P>
<P>
His is a minority view. Cassandra Einstein, a San Marino artist who sips cafe
au lait at a Colorado Boulevard cafe, likes it just fine.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody who lives in Hollywood thinks this is the slow lane out here," said
Einstein, a recent Los Angeles transplant. "But this is a charming little place
to get yourself together in the morning."
</P>
<P>
A mile or so to the north of the parade route, Carolyn Stonestreet sits on a
bench at a Fair Oaks Avenue bus stop, talking about her troubled life in
northwest Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
"I'm basically homeless now," she said. "I'm staying with my sister and her
boyfriend. I took my kids to their grandmother."
</P>
<P>
Stonestreet's problems began when, after a long custody fight for her children
-- now 5 and 9 -- she was dismissed by the pharmaceutical firm where she had
worked for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
"Welfare sent me to a shelter in downtown Los Angeles," she said, sobbing
quietly. "I was terrified. I came back to Pasadena and told the social worker
it was unbelievable. I'd rather sleep on the streets over here than go back
over there."
</P>
<P>
This is the neighborhood where the underclass of Pasadena lives. Predominantly
black, northwest Pasadena had about 102 drive-by shootings in 1989. Six people
were killed and 69 injured -- many of them innocent bystanders -- in shooting
incidents, police say.
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood also has many hard-working homeowners and apartment dwellers,
sometimes overwhelmed by the crime around them. "The attitude by the
authorities seems to be, as long as it's not blown out of proportion, let it
go," one resident said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a population that's basically a labor population" but "there's not a
single smokestack in Pasadena," said Ibrahim Naeem, director of the
Pasadena-Foothill Branch of the Los Angeles Urban League.
</P>
<P>
The result is a vast gap between haves and have-nots. A city commission on
youth and families recently compared income levels in a census tract in
northwest Pasadena with one in wealthy west Pasadena. They found a $68,170
difference in median family income.
</P>
<P>
Often, that gap translates into a black Pasadena and a white Pasadena, black
leaders contend. "The city's attitude in the past can be called neglect at
best," Naeem said.
</P>
<P>
The Board of City Directors (Pasadena's city council) has tried recently to
assuage the restive black community, which constitutes about 25% of the city.
Last month, after months of criticism, the board authorized a $100,000 audit of
city personnel practices to determine whether city policies have been racist or
sexist over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
When the parade reaches the corner of Marengo Avenue, it is in developer
territory, say slow-growth activists.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the two-block Plaza Pasadena mall, between Marengo and Los
Robles avenues, was one of the first signs that the city was on a
no-holds-barred growth track, said Mike Salazar, co-chairman of Pasadenan
Residents In Defense of our Environment (PRIDE).
</P>
<P>
After 1977, when the Community Redevelopment Agency demolished such older
structures as the Pasadena Athletic Club to make way for the mall, slow-growth
resistance started to build. There were early battles, like a 1980 petition
drive that ultimately stopped a plan for twin office towers in the middle of
town. But boxy office towers continued to spring up, particularly along
traffic-clogged Lake and Los Robles avenues.
</P>
<P>
City planners say 156 office buildings have been built in the city since 1980,
almost doubling office space to about 9.7 million square feet. At the same
time, condominium projects popped up like toadstools.
</P>
<P>
"People would go to the city and complain that it wasn't fair to their
neighborhoods, which had been single-family homes for years," said Claire
Bogaard, executive director of the preservation group Pasadena Heritage. "But
generally the developers got their way."
</P>
<P>
The scene was set for a battle at the polls. Last March, PRIDE won, as 57% of
the voters approved a measure to restrict new housing and large commercial
projects.
</P>
<P>
City leaders worry that the measure will stifle the entrepreneurial spirit that
brought Pasadena out of economic doldrums. "It's already causing a housing
scarcity and driving up prices," Mayor Thomson said.
</P>
<P>
William Podley, president of the Pasadena-based real estate firm of Podley
Caughey Associates, says prices are indeed skyrocketing.
</P>
<P>
"Properties we handled last year for $190,000 or $195,000 are going for
$240,000, maybe even $250,000." he said.
</P>
<P>
The parade passes Hill Avenue, a main thoroughfare for Pasadena City College
and, a few blocks to the south, Caltech. A mile north of the route, on
Washington Boulevard, Mary Donikian doles out baklava for a customer at the
American Armenian Grocery.
</P>
<P>
It is a fragrant place, full of the dried fruits, nuts and cheeses that
Armenians serve during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
Armenians used to celebrate Christmas on Jan. 6, commemorating the arrival of
the three kings on the Day of Epiphany. "But we're getting used to American
ways," said Donikian, who came to the United States from Lebanon 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Getting used to those ways has been tough going for many of Pasadena's 15,000
Armenians. Refugees from discrimination in the Middle East and repression in
the Soviet Union, most arrive with little knowledge of English and few job
skills.
</P>
<P>
Yet Pasadena has accepted them with extraordinary generosity, Armenian leaders
say.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the Board of Directors gave Armenians a special protected status in
awarding city contracts and recruiting for city jobs. Now, a polling firm is
conducting the first-ever Armenian census to implement an affirmative action
program.
</P>
<P>
It has not been easy sledding, said Serge Samoniantz, whose firm is doing the
census.
</P>
<P>
"Those who have had experience with local government in the Soviet Union are
extremely distrustful of anything that smacks of government," Samoniantz said.
</P>
<P>
A hard right onto Sierra Madre Boulevard, and the parade comes to rest in
Victory Park, where the colorful floats are then put on display.
</P>
<P>
It's an appropriate resting place. Eastern Pasadena is the middle-income,
home-owning bedrock of the city. The residents here are civil servants,
contractors, small-business owners.
</P>
<P>
A few blocks east of Victory Park is Upper Hastings Ranch, a hillside
neighborhood of winding streets and slanted roofs.
</P>
<P>
The holiday season is their neighborhood's time to shine.
</P>
<P>
For the past 34 years, residents have lit up the night with a torrent of
Christmas lights. So extravagant is the display that tour buses and long lines
of cars edge through narrow streets.
</P>
<P>
Committees impose unifying themes on each block -- Cartwright Street has the 12
Days of Christmas -- and a panel of judges awards prizes for the best use of
lights and the best humorous display.
</P>
<P>
The Upper Hastings Ranch "light-up," as residents call it, is brilliant but, in
the end, ephemeral. From her front lawn, Dottie Csik, whose evergreen bushes
are seeded with tiny white lights, takes in the short-lived illumination.
</P>
<P>
"After New Year's, it's like a morgue around here," she said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rose Parade Starts at 8:10 A.M.
</P>
<P>
The 101st Tournament of Roses Parade begins at 8:10 a.m. at Orange Grove and
Del Mar boulevards, proceeds east along Colorado Boulevard to Sierra Madre
Boulevard and ends at Paloma Street about two hours later. Post-parade viewing
opens at 1:30 p.m. For more information, the parade hot line is (818) 584-5983.

MAN FATALLY STABBED IN PIZZA RESTAURANT;
</P>
<P>
CRIME: VICTIM CRASHES CHILD'S BIRTHDAY PARTY AND ARGUES WITH HIS ESTRANGED
GIRLFRIEND, THE BOY'S MOTHER. SHE IS ARRESTED.

<P>
A man was fatally stabbed by his estranged girlfriend after he crashed a
birthday party for her 3-year-old son Saturday night at a crowded family pizza
restaurant in Granada Hills, police said.
</P>
<P>
Robert Bridges, 28, a millwright from Apple Valley, was stabbed once or twice
in the chest in a quarrel with Cynthia Stafford, 23, of Pacoima, Los Angeles
police Detective Ken Buscarino said.
</P>
<P>
Bridges died at about 8:30 a.m. Sunday at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission
Hills.
</P>
<P>
Stafford, who was described as unemployed, was being held without bail on
suspicion of murder, police said.
</P>
<P>
The couple had lived together about six months before breaking up and Bridges
apparently went to the restaurant to try to revive the relationship, Buscarino
said.
</P>
<P>
The detective said Stafford went to the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theater
with her son, about five other children and as many as 10 adult friends and
relatives. Bridges showed up, uninvited, at about 7:30 p.m..
</P>
<P>
"He was not the boy's father, but he had apparently befriended him when he was
with the mother and somehow learned about the party," the detective said.
</P>
<P>
The couple had a lengthy argument, Buscarino said. Stafford left the restaurant
and walked to a nearby supermarket, where she bought a 10-inch steak knife and
returned, the detective said.
</P>
<P>
The stabbing took place about 9 p.m. near a salad bar in a dining room, some
distance away from the youngsters at the birthday party, who apparently did not
witness it, Buscarino said.
</P>
<P>
However, the detective added, officers interviewed about 10 eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure a lot of people saw it and grabbed their kids and left as fast as
they could," Detective John Birrer said. "I'm surprised as many people hung
around as they did by the time we got there."
</P>
<P>
Buscarino said Bridges was aware that Stafford had a knife, but "he may have
thought she was just threatening him. But he was wrong. She did him in.
</P>
<P>
"It went down quickly," the detective said. "Bridges got stabbed and he didn't
fall down or scream. He was able to stand upright until his friends in the
party drove him to the hospital."
</P>
<P>
Stafford's son was placed in the custody of his maternal grandmother, Buscarino
said.
</P>
<P>
A woman, who identified herself as Stafford's mother, said she was at work
several weeks ago when her daughter phoned to report that Bridges was at the
Pacoima home Stafford and her son share with her.
</P>
<P>
"He was just banging on the door. Pounding, pounding, pounding. I could hear it
through the telephone," the woman said. "I told my supervisor I had to leave
because somebody's trying to break into my house. When I got here, he was still
pounding.
</P>
<P>
"Hell, he's a damn nut, and I guess she is too," the woman said of the victim
and her daughter.
</P>
<P>
"It was her baby's birthday party. This is what it started out as. And it
turned into a tragedy."

HORMONES: PRESSURE TO HELP CHILDREN GROW TALLER IS STRONG. BUT MANY EXPERTS ARE
UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE LONG-TERM RISKS AND EFFECTS.

Imagine a world in which short children are treated with a drug to make them
taller. Although it borders on the Brave New World -- depicted in the 1930s
novel by Aldous Huxley in which human embryos were tampered with so that they
developed standard traits -- the technology necessary to turn this science
fiction into fact is already being explored.
</P>
<P>
For decades, physicians have been treating some midget children with growth
hormone extracted from human cadavers to boost their height by the time they
reach adulthood. (Unlike dwarfs, who have disproportionately large heads in
relation to their limbs and torso, midgets are proportionately short).
</P>
<P>
But only since 1985 has genetic engineering made it possible to generate the
hormone in large enough quantities to be used for short children who are
growing so slowly that they are not expected to reach more than 5 feet, 3
inches if they are boys or 4 feet, 10 inches if girls.
</P>
<P>
The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Md.,
is currently conducting clinical tests to assess the effectiveness of growth
hormone in these "normal" children, who, unlike midgets, do not have a classic
growth hormone deficiency. The results will not be in for at least 10 years,
but that has not stopped some doctors from using the therapy on such children.
</P>
<P>
The use of growth hormone is presenting an ethical dilemma in a society that
often measures the worth of people by their height. Others argue that no
substance, regardless of one's ethical point of view, should be used widely
until it is proven safe and effective.
</P>
<P>
At a recent state-of-the-art conference on growth hormone therapy sponsored by
the Swedish Medical Research Council in Stockholm, about the only point 15
experts on the therapy could agree on was that tests used to detect a growth
hormone deficiency are not reliable, said Louis Underwood, a University of
North Carolina pediatric endocrinologist who attended the conference.
</P>
<P>
Without dependable tests, physicians cannot separate children who are growing
slowly because of a medical condition that is stemming their growth hormone
production from children who are merely following a family tradition of being
short. While it makes sense that physicians should correct the former, treating
genetically short children with the hormone raises thorny ethical issues.
</P>
<P>
Short stature is not necessarily a disease, points out Leona Cuttler, a
University of Chicago pediatric endocrinologist in an article in the Journal of
the American Medical Assn. last year, but part of the normal variation in human
appearance. Physicians who try to boost a normal short child's height with
growth hormone may be likened to plastic surgeons who try to improve appearance
with nose jobs and tummy tucks.
</P>
<P>
But consenting adults submit to these cosmetic procedures, not children.
Because growth hormone therapy is only thought to be effective in children and
not full-grown adults, a child's parents and physician must decide if he should
be treated.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be very careful when deciding whom to treat," says pediatric
endocrinologist Gilbert August of George Washington University. "Often it isn't
the kids who are worried about being short, but their parents.
</P>
<P>
"These parents, who are short themselves, vicariously relive through the child
their own failures in high school about not being able to make the team, etc.
I've often joked that if you could just do a 'parentectomy' these kids would be
fine."
</P>
<P>
But even without parental pressures, short stature can be emotionally costly in
our society, which values height. "The money you save by not giving growth
hormone," says August, "you may as well give to a psychiatrist."
</P>
<P>
Some scientists cite studies showing success is tied to height, with taller
people making more money or having more prestigious jobs on the average than
shorter individuals. The midgets who portrayed the munchkins in the movie "The
Wizard of Oz," for example, earned less money than the dog Toto.
</P>
<P>
Short height, however, is a relative term that is dependent on the range of
height in a population. When August told a group of dwarfs, for example, about
the possibility of using growth hormone to boost a normal but short boy's final
adult height from 5 feet, 1 inch to 5 feet, 3 inches, they were horrified.
"People 5 feet tall are like giants to dwarfs who typically aren't taller than
4 feet, 3 inches," he explained.
</P>
<P>
By definition, a child is short if he is in the lowest 5% of height in a normal
population. But if doctors were able to effectively treat all these children
with growth hormone, they would not eliminate short stature but rather create a
new crop of short kids -- there will always be someone in the short range of
normal.
</P>
<P>
"Where to draw the line and decide whom to treat with growth hormone is a
dilemma we're struggling with right now," says pediatric endocrinologist Susan
Rose of the University of New Mexico Medical Center in Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
The high cost of growth hormone therapy is also an issue. "We're talking
$60,000 to $70,000 per inch," says pediatric endocrinologist Melvin Grumbach of
UC San Francisco. "Is a few inches worth the equivalent of what it costs to
send a kid to college?"
</P>
<P>
Another reason not to treat a normal short child with growth hormone, Grumbach
added, is that "the jury is still out" on the effectiveness and long-term
safety of the therapy used on these children. "If you know a therapy is
effective and has no risk tied to it, you do it," says endocrinologist Gordon
Cutler of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. "But if
both the risk and the effectiveness are uncertain, you should do nothing and
let nature take its course, or you should enroll the patient in a clinical
trial so we can learn what the risks and benefits are."
</P>
<P>
There are no clear-cut health risks associated with growth hormone therapy, but
there are some unconfirmed findings that indicate the therapy -- which usually
consists of three injections of the hormone per week for several years -- might
boost a person's chances of developing diabetes, hypothyroidism or leukemia.
</P>
<P>
"If we knew the therapy would give a person a four-inch gain in their final
adult height rather than just a two-inch gain, the risks are probably worth
taking," says Cutler, "but we don't know that yet."
</P>
<P>
Since most normal children who have been tested with growth hormone therapy
have not reached adulthood yet, their final gain in height is not known.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the parental pressure on pediatricians to treat more short
children with growth hormone is building. "Unfortunately, everybody imbues
growth hormone with magical qualities because we value growth so much," says
Rose.
</P>
<P>
What decisions pediatricians make on whom to treat with growth hormone will
have bearing on the use of future therapies likely to be developed to boost the
appearance rather than the health of children. "If pediatricians do not respond
to these dilemmas thoughtfully, carefully and forcefully," Cuttler wrote in her
article, "other decision makers, whose decisions may reflect political, social
or market forces, may then respond in ways that do not reflect the best
interests of children."

BREAST CANCER TREATMENT RECYCLES BONE MARROW

Bone marrow transplants are helping treat some women with advanced stages of
breast cancer, researchers from the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in
Baltimore reported at the recent San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in Texas.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 140,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year.
</P>
<P>
About 30% of these patients have a recurrence of the disease in other organs,
such as the liver, the brain and the lungs. At present, there is no effective
treatment for advanced breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
But an autologous bone marrow transplant -- in which a portion of the patient's
own bone marrow is removed, treated chemically to kill cancer cells and
reimplanted -- could help some of these women. With their highly sensitive bone
marrow removed, the patients are better able to tolerate higher doses of
cancer-killing drugs, which are then more effective at knocking out the cancer.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, oncologist Nancy Davidson and her colleagues have performed this
procedure on 20 patients with advanced breast cancer. Nine patients have
responded completely; 11 showed partial responses during nine months of
follow-up after the treatment.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen centers are using the marrow transplants to battle advanced
breast cancer at a cost of $75,000 to $100,000 per patient.

DIVERSE L.A. DRUG CULTURE THREATENS AIDS OUTREACH
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Rosas and Ronny Alvarado were out trawling for hypes in a wild pocket of
downtown Los Angeles, carrying the message about AIDS and dirty needles to an
urban prairie where an addict can get high for as little as 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
A man squatted on the curb, pumping heroin into a dappled arm. Nearby, another
guided a skillet over an open fire, sauteing fish. People stood, slumped,
against a chain-link fence, smoking cocaine. A woman flashed a leering grin at
Alvarado.
</P>
<P>
Alvarado approached her. Had she heard about AIDS? Did she know the risks of
dirty needles and unprotected sex? Could she use a few condoms? Nope, the woman
retorted perfunctorily: She was a woman; she didn't need one.
</P>
<P>
It's not easy spreading the word about AIDS to intravenous drug users, now a
prime target of the epidemic in Los Angeles County. The obstacles range from
the life styles of many addicts to the complex culture of drug use in the
nation's second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
Geography is destiny in Los Angeles County: The sprawl of the region has shaped
the drug market, and thus the AIDS epidemic. The county's vastness has slowed
the spread of AIDS among drug users, but it is making it difficult to reach
those at greatest risk.
</P>
<P>
In East Coast cities like New York, intravenous drug use is centralized.
Hundreds of addicts share needles daily in shooting galleries. As a result,
more than half of New York City's estimated 200,000 addicts are believed to be
infected with the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
But that same density makes addicts easy to find. Public health workers
routinely canvass the shooting galleries of cities such as New York and Newark.
They have alerted addicts to the risk of AIDS and thus helped cut down on the
sharing of contaminated needles.
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, by contrast, there are few places, except Skid Row,
where addicts congregate in large numbers. Drug use is spread out and tends to
occur among small groups. Those who share needles tend to do so with a few
friends, again and again.
</P>
<P>
For that reason, and the fact that the virus came late to the West Coast, the
HIV infection rate among addicts here appears to have remained relatively low.
Just 3% to 5% of the county's estimated 80,000 to 120,000 intravenous drug
users are infected, researchers believe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult to Reach
</P>
<P>
But that same diffuseness makes it difficult to reach users. They are scattered
all over the county, only occasionally in pockets. Public-health workers find
themselves forced to go door to door, scouring neighborhoods for an entree,
hoping to happen upon a user.
</P>
<P>
Gangs, too, create obstacles to spreading the word. Their role in drug dealing
creates risks for public health workers in some areas. Most outreach workers
say they avoid working after dusk -- the time when, some acknowledge, addicts
are most accessible.
</P>
<P>
The county's cultural mix makes their task even more complex. In some Latino
communities, experts say addicts are inadvertently protected. Sheltered at
home, rather than forced out, they are harder to reach. Their families may
offer the only access.
</P>
<P>
"Intravenous drug use is happening all over," said John L. Brown, who runs one
of the five county-funded programs doing outreach with addicts. "But it
manifests itself differently depending on culture, socioeconomic circumstances
and even the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
"So what really burns me is people from San Francisco and New York who say,
'This is how you do street outreach,' " said Brown, director of the Los Angeles
Centers for Alcohol and Drug Abuse. "It's a much more complicated problem than
that."
</P>
<P>
But without effective outreach, experts believe infection inevitably will
spread.
</P>
<P>
Many addicts here admit they still share needles and syringes. Those who use
bleach to sterilize their equipment say they do so only intermittently. Many
use condoms only rarely, yet condoms offer the only means of avoiding infection
during sex.
</P>
<P>
One preliminary survey of 100 addicts in the San Fernando Valley found that
needle-sharing remains common. Yet use of bleach to clean needles was
relatively rare. Many of the users surveyed had multiple sex partners or
frequented prostitutes, but few reported using condoms.
</P>
<P>
Even so, county-funded AIDS outreach workers remain barred by the Board of
Supervisors from giving out condoms or bleach -- an approach used widely
elsewhere in the United States and abroad and credited with having helped
change addicts' behavior.
</P>
<P>
Among the homeless, activists believe drug use is rising. Among bisexual drug
users, as many as 30% to 40% may be infected, researchers say. Some say there
may also be a "microepidemic" of infection among the county's prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
Others in the field see a rise in "dual addiction," especially among
Mexican-American addicts -- the supplementing of a heroin habit with low-priced
cocaine. They find that ominous: Dual addiction is especially risky and can be
more difficult to treat.
</P>
<P>
Treatment -- getting off drugs -- is the ultimate form of AIDS "risk
reduction." But access to programs remains a problem in the county. The wait
for admission to a subsidized program ranges from weeks to months. And the
price often serves as a powerful deterrent.
</P>
<P>
"What makes people comfortable (ignoring the threat of AIDS for addicts) is the
thought that if they wanted help, they could get it," Brown said. "The reality
is, if they all decided to kick, there's nothing for them."
</P>
<P>
How fast the AIDS virus is spreading among drug users is not entirely clear.
</P>
<P>
M. Douglas Anglin, who heads UCLA's Drug Abuse Research Group, has studied
rates of infection among addicts in treatment. His findings and others suggest
that perhaps 2% were infected in 1986 and that the rate is still below 5%.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
History of Drug Use
</P>
<P>
According to those studies, the virus appears to be "pooled" among male
intravenous drug users with some history of homosexual activity, and among
women intravenous drug users with some history of prostitution, Anglin said.
</P>
<P>
But some authorities have wondered whether the findings are reliable; that is,
are addicts in treatment representative of addicts on the street? If men and
women in treatment are less likely to be infected, the overall rate could be
higher.
</P>
<P>
Anglin expressed confidence in the data. He said the county could have as much
as a three- to-five-year grace period before the infection rate reaches that
critical 6% to 8% level at which a rapid rise could be expected to occur.
</P>
<P>
Who are the drug users at risk in Los Angeles County? They are as diverse as
the county itself. They include longshoremen, physicians, mothers, truck
drivers and prostitutes, from San Pedro and East Los Angeles to the San
Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
Their drugs of choice, and their using patterns, vary widely. Heroin remains
dominant among Latino addicts, experts say. Cocaine has eclipsed heroin in the
black community. Both those drugs, as well as methamphetamine and PCP, are
widely used by Anglos.
</P>
<P>
The following sketches hint at the extraordinary diversity of drug use in Los
Angeles County. While the people profiled have escaped infection, their stories
illustrate the insidious power of addiction and a life style with potentially
lethal consequences.
</P>
<P>
Take Cheryl, a 33-year-old mother of three from East Los Angeles, who asked not
to be identified by her real name. Experts in drug addiction say her experience
is common among women addicts: They fall into drug use on the heels of men.
</P>
<P>
Cheryl grew up in East Los Angeles, one of five children. Her father is a
transit worker; one sister is an aspiring wrestler. She completed high school
and, she says, she had little interest in drugs until she met the man who would
become her second husband.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, faced with his growing addiction, Cheryl tried heroin. It was a
reckless bid for attention; his drug use seemed to have shouldered her out of
his life. She followed him into the bathroom where he was fixing, and insisted
he inject her too.
</P>
<P>
For several years, Cheryl used only occasionally. But when her husband began
dealing, they both began using more often. Emerging, horrified, from a two-week
binge, she resolved to quit. But when she tried, she became violently,
intolerably sick.
</P>
<P>
After her husband was sent to prison, Cheryl tried to control her habit. She
held down a job and cared for her children. Then one day, an old connection
showed up at the furniture warehouse where she worked. As a favor, he gave her
some heroin to sell.
</P>
<P>
Cheryl began dealing, and used up the rest of the supply. From there, she slid
into prostitution. She lost jobs, was sent to jail and was briefly cut off by
her family. She remembers spending Christmas on her parents' front porch,
barred from the house.
</P>
<P>
"In this type of life, it's nothing but an evil merry-go-round," she said
recently, in an interview at a methadone-maintenance program where she is
enrolled. "It's a vicious master, you go in a circle. It's a never-ending
circle."
</P>
<P>
A similar tale comes from a man who asked to identify himself only as Doc, a
35-year-old psychologist living in Los Angeles County. He began using heroin
while working as a drug-addiction researcher at a prominent Southern California
university.
</P>
<P>
Intrigued by the world of the men and women he was interviewing in motel rooms
throughout the state, Doc began experimenting with heroin. He compares his
curiosity to that of an apple researcher who has never tasted the fruit: "I
wanted to taste the apple."
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, he began using more frequently, driving from his home in the San
Fernando Valley to the heart of East Los Angeles to score. Even after his wife
overdosed, and with a 10-month-old child at home, Doc found himself powerless
to quit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rebuilding His Life
</P>
<P>
Early last year, he entered a residential treatment program. His wife had left
him, taking their child. He was having difficulty holding down jobs. He has
remained clean ever since, he says, and is in the process of piecing together
his life.
</P>
<P>
"It will kill you," said Doc, who, like Cheryl, escaped without becoming
infected with the human immuno-deficiency virus, which causes AIDS. "If you're
lucky, it will only kill you psychologically. So you have a chance for another
life."
</P>
<P>
Contrary to stereotypes, the life of an addict can be cruelly demanding -- in
ways that make it difficult to get the AIDS message across. It is a life in
which immediate needs eclipse longer-term goals, in which caution is not a top
priority.
</P>
<P>
Many addicts, for example, rise before dawn to get high. Then they turn
immediately to the urgent business of securing their next fix -- a task that
may entail shoplifting, theft, prostitution, moving hot goods, wheeling and
dealing, or selling drugs.
</P>
<P>
Paul Rosas, a former addict, supported his habit for a time by ripping off
other addicts, peddling crack vials filled with soap or peanuts. He became so
hated on the streets that, he recalls, he could only come out at night, his
head covered by a hood.
</P>
<P>
Personal hygiene, even eating, often fall by the wayside. Many addicts have
chronic health problems, from tooth decay to liver and lung disease. Suspicious
of institutions, and sometimes mistreated by doctors, many shy away from
medical clinics.
</P>
<P>
"There's no reality outside of the next two to three hours," said Barbara
Casucci, director of Cornerstone Health Services, a methadone program in Pico
Rivera. "There's no long-term planning, no looking forward to Christmas or
Easter. It's just how are you going to get through the next two or three
hours."
</P>
<P>
For that reason, among others, AIDS outreach workers have a hard job. Just
getting the attention of an addict on the street is no small feat. What should
be a 20-minute presentation on AIDS and how to avoid it ends up abbreviated
into a fleeting, one-minute rap.
</P>
<P>
Then there's the problem of vocabulary -- both language and lingo. In some
communities, adults find it difficult to talk about sex. On Skid Row, phrases
like "intravenous drug user" are jettisoned in favor of more graphic
alternatives such as, "D'you slam?"
</P>
<P>
Bleach and condoms, many outreach workers say, would make their job easier.
They would catch addicts' attention and give them something for their time.
They would also serve as invaluable tools in explaining precisely how to
protect oneself against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of those tools, outreach workers fall back on the power of
repetition. By being visible on the streets, and offering repeated reminders,
they hope they will eventually get across their point.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ongoing Process'
</P>
<P>
"These people are busy. They're trying to get money, trying to get paid, trying
to get high," said Rosas, who does outreach along Skid Row for Brown's agency.
"It's an ongoing process. No one's going to learn this in one shot."
</P>
<P>
One afternoon this month, Rosas threaded his way down the crowded sidewalks of
downtown Los Angeles making his regular rounds -- past the park where addicts
gather, past the curbside cardboard dormitories, past hotels where
transvestites co-habit, four to a room.
</P>
<P>
Traveling with him was Ronny Alvarado, a 20-year-old former addict who works
with the Homeless Outreach Project, a Skid Row agency that, among other things,
accompanies AIDS outreach workers and makes available free condoms and bleach.
</P>
<P>
(That agency's funding comes from the city, not the county. So it is not bound
by the county supervisors' ban on distributing condoms and bleach.)
</P>
<P>
The two men loped through the streets, greeting familiar faces, cajoling
passers-by, scanning arms and necks for tracks. They offered pamphlets,
condoms, information. Some people listened, others kept walking. A few
protested, in mock offense, they were happily married.
</P>
<P>
"You can't push yourself on nobody out here," explained Rosas, a 225-pound man
with a buzz cut who put in his own time on the New York City streets. "You got
to know when to step, when to go. If you don't, you may end up dead where you
stand."
</P>
<P>
Over the hills in the San Fernando Valley, three AIDS outreach workers from an
agency called El Proyecto del Barrio were working Van Nuys, moving methodically
from house to house on a run-down street where residents said drug deals
regularly go down.
</P>
<P>
There, the obstacles are different. Drug use goes on mostly behind closed
doors. "The biggest problem is identifying where these people are," said John
Paloma, 36, one of the outreach workers. "Then, when you've found them, it's
convincing them we're not the police."
</P>
<P>
The outreach workers watch for tell-tale signs: Cars pulling up outside certain
houses, visitors returning one time too often. They ask questions: Any signs of
drug use in the neighborhood? They hope their message makes its way into the
right hands.
</P>
<P>
In Paloma's experience, most addicts now know about bleach. Whether they use
it, he cannot be certain. Most say they no longer share equipment, but Paloma
remembers when he was using: Everyone shared because no one wanted to be caught
carrying an outfit.
</P>
<P>
For that reason, Paloma used to stash equipment around town -- for example,
high atop public toilets. Now, working the parks, he occasionally runs a hand
through those familiar crannies. When he comes upon a syringe, he leaves a
pamphlet.
</P>
<P>
Are outreach programs working? In Los Angeles County, it is difficult to know.
Most programs have been operating little more than a year. And there has been,
so far, no comprehensive study assessing whether addicts' practices have
changed.
</P>
<P>
El Proyecto del Barrio, the agency that covers the San Fernando Valley,
recently completed a survey of 100 intravenous drug users. The findings are
preliminary and the study sample small, but the results indicate there is more
work to be done.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sharing Needles
</P>
<P>
Nearly 75% of those surveyed said they share needles, at least occasionally.
More than half said they clean their equipment with water -- which is
ineffective. Only one third said they cleaned their equipment with bleach and
water, the only proven method.
</P>
<P>
As for sex, 33% said they had multiple partners. Nearly one in five said they
frequented prostitutes. Yet most never use condoms and only 30% use them
sometimes. Four people said they used them all the time.
</P>
<P>
"Changing attitudes and behavior takes time," said Kimberly Green, outreach
project coordinator for El Proyecto del Barrio. "Eventually, they hit bottom.
Then they become more vulnerable."
</P>
<P>
Those spreading the word say they have no grandiose expectations.
</P>
<P>
"We're not out to solve the problem of AIDS," said Mike Neely, who runs the
Homeless Outreach Project out of a storefront in the heart of Skid Row. "What
we're trying to do is keep the person in front of us alive long enough to deal
with their life.
</P>
<P>
"If we can keep the person alive 'til they're ready to hear the message, maybe
they'll be OK," said Neely. "If they die first, all we've got is a dead drug
addict."

SAVANNAH, Ga.
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this elegant old city of graceful mansions in muted tones, Bud Hall's House
of Many Colors stands out like rap music at a Debussy concert.
</P>
<P>
You can almost hear the hot pink, lavender and blue paint that covers Hall's
nine-room Victorian home on Whitefield Square in the city's historic district.
And his 9-foot tall windows look even louder, 10 of them covered with paintings
of women dressed in colors of the rainbow.
</P>
<P>
As expected in a city that prides itself on antebellum charm and architecture,
a city that William Tecumseh Sherman spared after his March to the Sea because
it was "too beautiful" to destroy, many Savannah preservationists look at
Hall's home and see red. City officials took him to court, arguing that his
home is not in character with the rest of the historic neighborhood. But Hall
argues that preservation laws clash with his rights.
</P>
<P>
Sitting in a room that he uses for his hair styling businesses, Hall said
indignantly: "If I want to hang pictures of Zsa Zsa Gabor and Martin Luther
King in my window, that's my right. Our country was founded on property
rights."
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Hall's house has come to symbolize increasingly worrisome issues
surrounding the historic preservation movement. In Savannah, as in cities
across the country, questions are being raised about whether the movement has
become too powerful, too intrusive and whether preservation and progress are
compatible -- and affordable. The questions take on added weight as aging
cities increasingly rely on historic districts to attract visitors and help
fuel their service economies.
</P>
<P>
Across the nation, preservationists are battling to hold onto power they gained
during the last several decades of heightened awareness of architectural
treasures.
</P>
<P>
In Charleston, S.C., and San Francisco, preservationists have taken a beating
as they tried to convince some victims of the recent hurricane and earthquake
that, in repairing their damaged property, they should spend the extra money it
takes to buy materials like those destroyed rather than purchasing newer,
cheaper ones.
</P>
<P>
Pat Mellen of the Preservation Society of Charleston, said to be the nation's
oldest such organization (70 years old), said, "You have to explain to them
that you can put an asphalt roof on," instead of the more expensive metal, "but
you're going to lose it in 10 years. You're also going to lose tourism" because
the houses would not be attractive.
</P>
<P>
In South Pasadena, Calif., homeowners -- backed by the National Trust for
Historic Preservation -- struggle against a freeway that would destroy dozens
of historic houses. One angry homeowner called that prospect "cultural
suicide." The preservationists can lay claim to holding off the freeway for 20
years, but they have not been able to kill it. The state continues to press
forward with new plans.
</P>
<P>
In Madison, Ga., preservationists sought to block the opening of a Hardee's
hamburger shop which would result in the razing of two historic homes in the
quaint old east Georgia town. But they lost. The restaurant now sits just off
the town's main square, painted white, like many of the historic homes around
it.
</P>
<P>
"It's the only antebellum Hardee's in the world," said Don Stacy of the local
chamber of commerce, adding that a Piggly Wiggly grocery store is located just
across the street from Hardee's. "I wouldn't call it an antebellum Piggly
Wiggly," he said, "but it is a quality construction with a quality appearance."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Influence Considerable
</P>
<P>
For many years, the preservation movement made great political headway. And its
influence is still considerable, even dominating, in many communities.
</P>
<P>
The national trust has identified 11 areas nationwide that it calls
"endangered," including South Pasadena, St. Simons, Ga., and the historic
district in Deadwood, S. D. "These places tell us who we were and who we are,"
said National Trust President J. Jackson Walter. "They deserve our protection."
</P>
<P>
But a backlash of sorts has been building, and nowhere is it more apparent than
in Savannah, where a 2.2-square-mile historic district graced by live oak trees
dripping Spanish moss boasts of some 1,100 historic buildings and 22 landscaped
squares.
</P>
<P>
Savannah is among the nation's oldest planned cities -- James Oglethorpe laid
it out in 1733 -- and possesses one of America's largest urban historic areas
designated as a landmark district by the U.S. Interior Department. Thus, the
plight of its preservation Establishment could set a pattern for others
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
"Savannah, along with other cities like Charleston, San Antonio and Annapolis
that have been working to preserve their history, are the recognized and
acknowledged exemplaries of historic preservation," Walter said. "Were it ever
to be the case when one of those cities changed direction sharply, we would, I
am certain, be alarmed" that other preservation efforts might be thwarted.
</P>
<P>
"When the leaders fall, everybody else gets nervous."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sweeping Control
</P>
<P>
Preservation officials exercise broad control over how a building is modified
and over whether one is built at all in this city of 150,000. An 11-member
Historic Board of Review that includes architects, builders and historians must
approve "any type of alteration that is visible from the public right of way,"
said Beth Reiter, Savannah's preservation officer.
</P>
<P>
The board is appointed by Mayor John Rousakis and the board of aldermen,
serving three-year terms.
</P>
<P>
The following changes are among those requiring a "certificate of
appropriateness" approved by the board and issued by the zoning commissioner:
</P>
<P>
 -- Demolition of a historic structure in the historic district.
</P>
<P>
 -- "Material change in the exterior appearance of" structures in the district.
</P>
<P>
 -- Moving a structure into, within or out of the district.
</P>
<P>
 -- Adding or altering awnings.
</P>
<P>
 -- "Material change" of existing walls, fences or sidewalks that are "subject
to view from a public street or lane."
</P>
<P>
Under a section of the ordinance called "visual compatibility factors," there
are 11 categories for judging new construction and proposed changes. They range
from height to roof shape to the "rhythm" (relationship) of the buildings with
other structures.
</P>
<P>
Preservationists argue that such considerations are not trivial, as they make a
city palatable to visitors, thereby making money. "If we do not safeguard the
character of our community, if we allow it to fray around the edges, people are
not going to be interested in coming to see it," said Stephanie Churchill,
executive director of the Historic Savannah Foundation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Behaving Like Nazis'
</P>
<P>
However, many here argue that focusing on the past is preventing progress for
the future. The board is "behaving like Nazis or like czars," Hall said.
"That's not what I want in my government."
</P>
<P>
Many people here disparage preservation officials, and some have become local
celebrities by defying city orders based on preservation officials' judgments.
</P>
<P>
Michael Faber, a Savannah delicatessen owner ran up against the wrath of
preservationists when he put up a red awning at his restaurant, located in the
historic district -- despite the fact that his sandwiches passed strenuous
taste tests.
</P>
<P>
He won his fight, but his bitterness, tinged with humor, lingers. "Preserve the
cemetery," Faber exhorts, "but don't put the businessman in it."
</P>
<P>
One after another, he zings one-liners at preservationists: Having them sit
around a table demanding to see paint samples is like "rearranging the deck
chairs on the Titanic," and, "If the world stopped, it would take Savannah 25
years to catch up."
</P>
<P>
And just to rub in his indignation on city officials, Faber makes sure his
bright red awning is well lighted at night, "so they don't miss it." His
matching red window sign trumpets, in white letters, "Faber's. A Savannah
Tradition since 1989."
</P>
<P>
Walter of the national trust is unamused. Citing "the extraordinarily beautiful
color of Old Savannah brick and the wonderful filigree of the wrought iron," he
is against "turning your back on what makes the place special."
</P>
<P>
Calling the current activist preservationist movement a "reaction against urban
renewal," Walter said: "If there is anything we have learned over the last 20
years, it is that the way you build a successful community is to make historic
preservation part of the plan."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sign of Trouble
</P>
<P>
A sign of the diminished clout of the preservationists was the construction of
the Hyatt Regency Hotel along the Savannah River earlier in the decade. It is
modest by many cities' standards, but here its peach-colored, boxy architecture
looms among the historic buildings. Built by local developer Merritt W. Dixon
III, it stands 7 stories high and has 346 rooms. The promise of its substantial
tax revenue as the city's largest hotel overcame bitter opposition from the
entrenched preservationist Establishment.
</P>
<P>
But no clash over preservation values here has been more remarkable than Bud
Hall's.
</P>
<P>
It began in October, 1987, when Hall tried out several colors on the Queen
Anne-style Victorian home, which was built in 1896. All the colors were
authentic from the Victorian period, Hall said the other day, showing a visitor
a chart called "Victorian Hues." He originally selected five colors, including
Public House, a robin's-egg blue, and Andover, a pink. At one point he even
painted his tin roof in pink stripes.
</P>
<P>
The Savannah Historic Review Board pounced on Hall, slapping him with a
stop-work order, arguing that his paint job was out of character with the rest
of the neighborhood. "Sof-f-f-t," said Hall, derisively. "They wanted colors
that were sof-f-f-t. Well, the Victorians were not soft. They were extremely
eclectic. They were whimsical."
</P>
<P>
The dispute escalated, with Hall getting hauled into court and fined $100. Last
year, he had an artist paint women on plywood panels, asserting that the panels
were an energy-saving measure for his windows. Preservationists and some of
Hall's neighbors hate the panels, but they remain on the windows.
</P>
<P>
"The windows are not a typical treatment for that style house," said Reiter in
unaffected understatement. "It looks like stained glass."
</P>
<P>
The house's notoriety has earned it a stop on the tour-bus route, and sometimes
the guide toots her horn at Hall, whose home is known as "House of Many
Colors."
</P>
<P>
Hall now talks of bigger battles with City Hall. "I want economic change in
this community," he said, asserting that the preservation Establishment should
be joining him and others in that struggle instead of mounting a paint patrol.
</P>
<P>
"We realize we need to attract business," said Reiter, but she argued that, in
trying to curb Hall's eclecticism, she was trying to prevent "bit by bit, piece
by piece, the unraveling of the historic district." Preservation and economic
progress "are not mutually exclusive," Reiter said.
</P>
<P>
But despite three decades of effort, preservationists have been unable to
energize much of this city's commercial district, most notably Broughton Street
and an ailing City Market, in the middle of the historic area.
</P>
<P>
In one recent study, titled "Is Savannah Growing Senile?," a group of business
and civic leaders calling itself Renaissance Savannah spared almost none of
Establishment Savannah, criticizing business, political and media leaders. The
report places the city ninth on a list of 14 Southeastern cities in population
growth -- behind Orlando, Fla., Montgomery, Ala., and Augusta, Ga. The report
likens Savannah to an "underdeveloped country."
</P>
<P>
Said Julie Smith, a member of the group and a Chatham County commissioner: "The
only industry that is growing is tourism. We need to get the city moving
again."
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of surveys, a lot of talking, a lot of writing and not a
damned bit of action," said one longtime business owner here.
</P>
<P>
It is debatable how much of this restiveness can be blamed on preservationists
blocking progress and discouraging people from coming here, but Reiter
acknowledges that "we're the target right now. Preservation is a wonderful
focal point."
</P>
<P>
Bud Hall is doing all he can to keep it that way, although, he says, he has
gone broke fighting City Hall.
</P>
<P>
He said that after his many appearances in court, filing appeals and paying
legal fees, he has been forced to file bankruptcy. "Lawyers aren't cheap," he
said, estimating that his expenses have run "into the thousands of dollars."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hall seems to relish his role as Savannah iconoclast. "I'm amused
by the whole thing," he said. "I don't know what I'll do next."

From Savannah, Ga., to South Pasadena, the influential historic preservation
movement finds itself battling to retain power. As the Column One story points
out, the controversy is perhaps best symbolized by the "House of Many Colors,"
a Victorian home in Savannah that has preservationists seeing red. Hot pink,
lavender and blue paint cover the house. Fueling the fire, owner Bud Hall,
right, had an artist paint women on plywood panels, asserting that this was an
energy-saving measure for his windows. MATTHEW STANLEY / For The Times

ISSUE OF JAPANESE RACISM GROWS WITH IMMIGRATION
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A chance encounter on a suburban train one recent Sunday sheds some awkward
light on the elusive problem of racism in Japan. It began when a little
Japanese girl pointed with fascination at a black woman and asked, "Daddy,
what's that?"
</P>
<P>
The father squirmed with embarrassment. He tried to satisfy the innocent
curiosity of his preschool daughter by reminding her of an old Chinese fable
known in Japan as "Saiyuki." The man prodded the child with the name Songoku,
hero of the tale, which is popular among children.
</P>
<P>
Songoku is a monkey.
</P>
<P>
The young black woman apparently did not understand enough Japanese to catch
the indignity of this literary allusion, but she grasped the meaning of the
child's blunt question.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a person," she told the little girl in Japanese, "just like you."
</P>
<P>
A tense situation dissolved into gushing smiles of international goodwill when
it was further established that the woman was an American. The child was told
she herself is a Japanese, and that was why they were different.
</P>
<P>
After her new "friends" got off the train, the woman confided to another
American that she felt more irritated than insulted.
</P>
<P>
"It's the same whether they're 3 or 20 years old, they stare and point," said
the woman, who had been in Japan about a year teaching English. "Japanese are
all children when it comes to dealing with other races."
</P>
<P>
The incident was isolated, and does not reflect how most Japanese feel about
people of other ethnic backgrounds. But it offers a clue as to where some
disturbing misunderstandings begin.
</P>
<P>
Furor has periodically erupted in the American black community over the last
several years at news that Japanese political leaders have made disparaging
remarks about blacks in public. Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, for
instance, drew heat in 1986 for saying America has a "low intelligence level"
because of its black and Hispanic minorities.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese toy company, Sanrio Inc., was denounced and forced to withdraw its
hot-selling line of "Little Black Sambo" dolls and beachwear last year after
press reports described how these caricatures, with their thick lips and
distorted features, were regarded here as cute rather than offensive.
</P>
<P>
Japan's insensitivity in matters of race does not end with negative black
stereotypes. A recent boom in anti-Semitic books has continued without serious
challenge from Japanese intellectuals. Members of Japan's ethnic Korean
minority, mostly descendants of forced laborers brought here during the
colonial period, still face discrimination in employment and marriage and only
lately have felt comfortable using their legal Korean names.
</P>
<P>
Now, stubborn attitudes of racial intolerance and xenophobia are bearing down
upon the tens of thousands of Asians who have come to Japan, often staying
illegally, to seek jobs at the lower echelons of this robust economy. While
small-scale employers desperately need unskilled workers to correct a labor
shortage, many Japanese oppose opening their borders for fear of increased
crime and social disorder.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a local newspaper disclosed the existence of an internal police
report that singled out Pakistanis for contempt, characterizing them as smelly
people with skin diseases who speak poor English, get mad when they are fed
pork without being told and tend to "lie in the name of Allah" during
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely necessary to wash your hands after questioning or detaining
(Pakistani suspects) because many of them suffer from contagious skin
diseases," said the document, a partial copy of which was obtained by The
Times. "Since they have a unique body odor, the detention and interrogation
rooms will stink."
</P>
<P>
Police officials have apologized to the Pakistani Embassy and said they will
revise the 179-page report, which was distributed in November, 1988, to
regional authorities by the National Police Agency's International Research and
Training Institute for Investigation.
</P>
<P>
The intent of the report was to "raise awareness" about people of an unfamiliar
culture, but it was badly worded, said Masahiro Tamura, a senior superintendent
in the agency's international criminal affairs division.
</P>
<P>
"There's been a sudden rise in crime by foreign visitors, but we know so little
about other countries, especially Pakistan," Tamura said. "We thought it would
be a good idea to say a few things about what kind of country it is, and give a
few examples."
</P>
<P>
Nationwide arrests of Pakistanis increased by more than five times since 1985,
to 78 cases in 1988. As many as 1,643 Chinese and Taiwanese were arrested last
year, but they were not mentioned in the agency's training manual.
</P>
<P>
Police are not the only ones with a low regard for Pakistanis, whose relatively
dark skin makes them stand out among other Asian visitors drawn to Japan by the
high yen and plentiful work.
</P>
<P>
The mayor of Kawaguchi, an industrial city in Saitama Prefecture (state) with a
large population of foreign workers, complained to a symposium on immigrant
labor earlier this month that "some Pakistanis embarrass staff at public bath
houses because they do not remove their underwear when bathing," according to
Kyodo News Service.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Yoji Nagase also reportedly quipped that "Japanese people could bump into
Pakistanis at night because of their dark skin." Nagase later insisted his
remarks did not imply racial prejudice.
</P>
<P>
In September, authorities at Warabi High School, also in Saitama, barred a
19-year-old Pakistani from working as a teacher's aide in an English class.
School officials told the Mainichi newspaper that the man was "a suspicious
person" and that "there are a lot of communicable diseases and crime among
Pakistanis."
</P>
<P>
Similar bias is encountered by workers from Bangladesh, who, like those from
Pakistan, were able to come to Japan as tourists -- without visas -- until
Tokyo tightened its immigration rules in April. A new law will soon require
foreigners to produce certification of visa status before they can work.
Employers will be face penalties for hiring illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese consider themselves a single race, and they think their society
will become dirty if foreigners come in," said a Bangladeshi businessman who
has lived here for 13 years -- and who asked not be identified by name to avoid
antagonizing his Japanese friends. "This attitude is deep in their hearts.
There's no proof of it, but if you talk to people you're made to understand."
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, Japanese have considered themselves victims of racial
discrimination for decades, and not entirely without cause. Japanese and
Chinese immigrants were deprived of civil rights in the United States earlier
this century during the regrettable era of "Yellow Peril," and a generation of
Japanese-Americans was confined to U.S. concentration camps after the attack on
Pearl Harbor in 1941.
</P>
<P>
A sense of persecution weighed heavily in Japan's decision to go to war with
the United States, and its territorial conquests were rationalized as an
attempt to liberate the region from Western colonial masters. That view remains
current among the powerful right wing of the political leadership, as
illustrated last year when Land Agency Chief Seisuke Okuno was forced to resign
his Cabinet post after declaring that Japan had justifiably fought against
Asian colonization by the "white race."
</P>
<P>
Even now, defenders of Japan's whaling industry routinely attack environmental
critics as racially motivated, and some observers see the specter of racism
lurking behind the emotional backlash by some Americans against the recent
surge of Japanese investment in the United States. They point out that there
are few complaints about corporate takeovers by the British.
</P>
<P>
One hawkish lawmaker, Shintaro Ishihara, rattled nerves in Washington earlier
this year by asserting in a book of essays that "racism is at the base of
U.S.-Japan trade friction."
</P>
<P>
Yet, despite this apparent gulf in communication, the Japanese have attempted
to repair damaged feelings in some of the most highly visible cases of racial
insensitivity. The Foreign Ministry issued a memorandum to the publishing
industry in September warning of Jewish revulsion toward a recent spate of
Japanese bestsellers that postulate Zionist conspiracies behind world events.
</P>
<P>
Some of the books may "offend the most sensitive areas of Jewish psychology,"
the memorandum said. "The fact that such anti-Semitic works are published
unchallenged and without criticism in Japan calls into question the common
sense of the Japanese people."
</P>
<P>
Government and publishing industry officials have so far responded positively
to complaints, "partly because it's bad for business," said Neil C. Sandberg,
director of the American Jewish Committee's Pacific Rim Institute, who recently
visited Tokyo with a delegation of Jewish leaders. "But part of it represents a
new understanding.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese have had very limited exposure to cultural differences for many
centuries and developed a sense of uniqueness that tends to encourage either
indifference or negative feelings toward foreigners," Sandberg said. "There's a
vacuum here because there's so little information about the Jews. We're worried
that these books may fill that void with negative stereotypes."
</P>
<P>
The potential for exporting intolerance also worries Sandberg, who noted that
the work of one of the most scurrilous anti-Semitic writers, Masami Uno, has
been translated into Korean.
</P>
<P>
Questions also have been raised about employment practices of Japanese
companies with operations abroad. Earlier this year, former employees of a U.S.
subsidiary of Recruit Co., the job-placement firm of political bribery scandal
fame, alleged that a secret code had been used to discriminate among applicants
on the basis of race and sex. When a client wanted to hire a Japanese or a
Latino, for example, the names "Mariko" or "Maria" were allegedly jotted on
internal memos.
</P>
<P>
In an echo of former Prime Minister Nakasone's slur about U.S. ethnic
diversity, a significant number of Japanese -- two out of five -- believe that
America's major economic problem is that it has too many minorities, according
to a recent Harris Poll cited in the magazine Business Week.
</P>
<P>
There are some encouraging signs of changing attitudes, however. Hajime Arita,
a 10-year-old, and his parents started a family campaign to fight racism in
Japan after reading about the "Little Black Sambo" controversy. They visited
Washington in August to meet black leaders and promote better understanding.
</P>
<P>
Japanese booksellers have removed copies of the children's book "Little Black
Sambo" from their shelves, and several companies have joined Sanrio in phasing
out products and designs featuring derogatory caricatures of blacks.
</P>
<P>
But the caricatures, essentially borrowed from the symbols of America's own
past, still proliferate on the Japanese landscape in signs and advertising
images.
</P>
<P>
One such eyesore is the sign outside a tiny pub in Tokyo's Ebisu neighborhood,
which calls itself "Chibi Kuro Sambo" -- Japanese for Little Black Sambo.
Inside is a log-cabin decor with comical black dolls displayed on the window
sill. The Japanese waitress has her hair set in a style resembling African
dreadlocks and wears a red gingham smock. Specialties on the menu are "little
black fried chicken" and "little black potatoes."
</P>
<P>
Owner Sachiko Sasaki does not see why there is such a fuss over the theme she
chose for her pub nine years ago. She has no plans to change the name.
</P>
<P>
"This had nothing to do with racial prejudice or how I feel about black
people," Sasaki said. "I've always thought Little Black Sambo was cute."
</P>
<P>
Tokyo Bureau research assistant Takeshi Yabe also contributed to this story.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Titan 3 rocket carrying British and Japanese communications satellites roared
into space Sunday night after nine postponements as Martin Marietta Corp.
entered the commercial launch business.
</P>
<P>
The 155-foot-tall booster blasted away from its launch pad at the Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station at 7:07 p.m. and gave thousands of spectators a
dazzling New Year's Eve show, brilliantly lighting the night sky as it climbed
toward orbit.
</P>
<P>
"Everything looks good," mission commentator Bob Gordon reported as the rocket
sped into space. Twenty minutes after liftoff mission director Vic Whitehead
reported the Titan 3 upper stage carrying the satellites had achieved a
successful orbit ranging from 117 to 437 miles high.
</P>
<P>
The Titan got away on its 10th attempt. Originally set for Dec. 7, the launch
was delayed once by a technical problem and eight times by strong, high
altitude winds. The wind was no problem Sunday night and the countdown
proceeded without a hitch to an on-time liftoff.
</P>
<P>
Packed in the nose cone of the most powerful U.S. commercial rocket were the
14,700-pound JCSAT-2 and the 3,230-pound Skynet 4 satellites.
</P>
<P>
Skynet 4A was ejected from the Titan's nose cone into its planned preliminary
orbit a little more than an hour after launch and JCSAT 2 followed about an
hour and a half later. On-board rocket motors were to boost the relay stations
to their operational altitude of 22,300 miles.
</P>
<P>
JCSAT-2 will complete a two-satellite Japanese domestic network, providing
telephone, television, facsimile and high-speed data services. It is owned by
the Japanese Communications Satellite Co.
</P>
<P>
Skynet 4 will be used by the British Ministry of Defense for communicating with
land, sea and air forces.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese company and British government share the $125-million cost of the
rocket and launch services provided by Martin Marietta.
</P>
<P>
Roaring with power, the Titan's boosters burned out about two minutes after
liftoff as planned and fell away into the Atlantic Ocean. The liquid-fueled
Titan "core" vehicle then continued the ascent, looking like a brilliant star
as the vehicle disappeared to the east.
</P>
<P>
The flight plan called for Skynet 4 to be deployed from the Titan's
second-stage nose cone one hour and 12 minutes after liftoff. JCSAT-2 was to
follow suit about an hour and a half after that.
</P>
<P>
The Titan 3, built at Martin Marietta's Denver plant, is the second big U.S.
rocket to enter the commercial market, launching payloads for a fee. McDonnell
Douglas was the first, with its Delta rocket hoisting a communications
satellite for British Satellite Broadcasting in August.
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics plans to enter the competition next year with its Atlas
rocket.
</P>
<P>
The three U.S. companies are competing with the European Space Agency's Ariane
rocket.

POLK, Neb.
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The land is tabletop flat between the Big Blue and Platte rivers, a good place
to get a clear view of the world: the bright red and orange sunsets of summer
and fall, the harsh winter winds that whip through small towns like freight
trains, and, come springtime, the return of migrating birds and the lush
prairie plant life.
</P>
<P>
"To stand centered in a 360-degree horizon," Norris W. Alfred once wrote, "is
to experience a natural worldliness, colorful and complete."
</P>
<P>
Alfred, editor and publisher of the Polk Progress, not only mirrored the
richness of the Nebraska horizon, but also used it as a place from which he
could comment on the world. The demise of the 82-year-old weekly newspaper,
which published its final issue last week, is being mourned by 900 avid
subscribers in 45 states.
</P>
<P>
The breadth of the subscription list -- including 75 from California -- is more
of a tribute to Alfred than to Polk, which he described as a town of "384
friendly citizens and one grouch."
</P>
<P>
Alfred, 76, is a left-wing populist in a solidly Republican state who likes to
rail against government secrecy, big businesses, big machines that destroy
family farms, chemicals that deplete precious topsoil, and any Republican
within striking distance.
</P>
<P>
Many newspapers have creeds and slogans, but Alfred has a mantra, "Slower Is
Better," which appears, along with a snail, on the masthead of the eight-page
newspaper. Type for the Progress was set on a hot-metal Linotype and the paper
was printed on a 100-year-old big cylinder Babcock printing press in a cramped
Main Street office.
</P>
<P>
The Progress could be anyone's hometown paper, featuring such pictures as Wilma
Flick with her large turnip. But it's the features, mostly written by Alfred,
that set the paper apart: the folksy Polking Around, the weather, an
impassioned editorial and a bird-watching column; Alfred, who once supported
himself as a water colorist, does pen-and-ink drawings for the paper.
</P>
<P>
The birding column is an opportunity not only to count birds, but, Alfred said,
"to point out the necessity for leaving trees, bushes and water in the land as
part of the birds' livable environment. It's an extension of what students
learn in kindergarten and maybe preschool -- sharing."
</P>
<P>
The weather column is unusual because it is never wrong -- it eschews forecasts
-- but it can make a political point: "This week's weather had Siberian
temperature readings in the deep-freeze range accompanied by a secretive
military mission of the space shuttle" (Feb. 7, 1985).
</P>
<P>
Away from a typewriter, the soft-spoken bachelor observes that "loco" residents
sometimes bristle at his politics, but they seem to have provided him with an
endless source of good copy. None is more quotable than Alvena Lind, who is in
her 80s and the leader of a three-woman team of paper folders, whose job is to
crease and fold the sheets of the paper into a manageable whole when it comes
off the press. A daughter once criticized Alvena for talking too much. "If you
don't talk," replied Alvena, "you never say anything." She also campaigns
regularly against sloth: "If you don't do anything, you get out of practice."
</P>
<P>
Alfred, of Swedish ancestry, never had to worry about a work ethic. He writes
most of his columns before the farmers get up. A Polk native, he worked briefly
for the Progress after graduating from high school in 1931, and became an
itinerant pressman and printer (he has a degree in chemistry from Doane College
in Crete, Neb.).
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, he came back to Polk to help his ailing parents who owned a
clothing store and several farms. In 1955, he bought the Progress with a small
loan and monthly payments of $100. Alfred soon realized he had acquired a
suspect printing business with old machines, a leaky roof and a precarious
future. Then a farmer named John Hultman came in and renewed his subscription,
telling Alfred: "I better pay for two years, then I don't have to come to town
so often."
</P>
<P>
With two years to prove himself, Alfred knew then his wandering days were over,
except for a yearlong absence in the early 1960s. The Progress, by Alfred's own
account, was not anything remarkable until the Vietnam War, when he decided it
was pointless fighting the Vietnamese when the United States really wanted to
fight Russians -- and said so.
</P>
<P>
His national following started to build in the late 1970s when some San
Francisco State University journalism teachers discovered Alfred (they
nominated him for a Pulitzer Prize in 1980).
</P>
<P>
Alfred announced his retirement last September and tried to sell the paper for
$25,000, but couldn't find any takers. He may start a newsletter, but the
Progress is gone.

The mayor of this northern town says that Roman Catholic Church officials have
sent him a bill for more than $20,000 for a series of special Masses celebrated
since 1630.
</P>
<P>
The church said the town requested the special Masses in the 17th Century when
it was troubled by the plague.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Giuliano Gaigher said Saturday that church authorities are now insisting
on payment of 10,000 lire (about $9) for each of seven votive Masses celebrated
each year since 1630. That would bring the total bill to about $22,000.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing historical research. We haven't found any commitment by the town"
to pay for the Masses, Gaigher said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
The Italian news agency ANSA quoted local church officials as saying they are
willing to work out a solution.

<P>
President Bush on Sunday sent a television greeting to the Soviet people,
offering "warmest greetings" for the New Year and for "a new world of our own
making."
</P>
<P>
In a video message to be broadcast on Soviet television, Bush praised Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as "a good partner in peace."
</P>
<P>
A companion message taped by Gorbachev is expected to be aired on U.S.
television, continuing an exchange begun by Gorbachev and former President
Ronald Reagan in the mid-1980s. It was not immediately clear when either
message would be broadcast.
</P>
<P>
"Given the war-torn history of this century, we should redouble our efforts to
forge a new century of peace and freedom," said Bush, who is vacationing in
Texas but who taped the message in Washington before he left.
</P>
<P>
Bush noted that "our nations have produced" leaders such as Abraham Lincoln,
Soviet novelist Leo Tolstoy, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and
Soviet dissident Andrei D. Sakharov.
</P>
<P>
"We have persevered as allies in a terrible war," he said. "The challenges we
face today are no less daunting. But with good will and determination on both
sides, I am confident our two peoples will be equal to the task."
</P>
<P>
Bush reiterated that the United States "seeks no advantage from the
extraordinary changes under way" in Eastern Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
With tears, clapping and shouts of "Viva Panama!" passengers made an emotional
return to Panama on Sunday morning on the first commercial flight to enter
since U.S. troops invaded and ousted strongman Manuel A. Noriega.
</P>
<P>
"We made it. Long live Panama!" yelled one woman who joined some 200 passengers
in wild clapping and cheering as Eastern Airlines Flight 4977 touched down.
</P>
<P>
"Panama is so beautiful, so beautiful," she repeated over and over.
</P>
<P>
Another woman, unable to contain her emotions, could do nothing but sob.
</P>
<P>
"I feel great. This is incredible," said one Panamanian businessman who has
lived in self-exile in the United States since March, 1988. He said he will
stay only a week now but plans to move back to Panama with his family by the
end of 1990.
</P>
<P>
Though all of the passengers interviewed said they were relieved that Noriega
was ousted, many were nervous about criticizing him, and all asked not to
quoted by name.
</P>
<P>
Omar Torrijos International Airport, named after Panama's previous leader, has
been transformed by the invasion.
</P>
<P>
The Panama Defense Forces, which under Noriega took over control of the ports
and customs and immigration services, had exercised absolute control over the
facility, lending it a sometimes sinister atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Passengers known for their opposition to Noriega were in the past forced off
planes by members of the PDF, harassed as they passed through immigration or
denied re-entry. Journalists were sometimes detained and interrogated by
suspicious PDF officers.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, travelers reacted with pleasure as heavily armed U.S. troops offered
New Year's greetings and the country's new civilian director of immigration
welcomed them to "our new Panama."
</P>
<P>
Jose Chen Barria, a member of the opposition Christian Democratic Party, was
cheered when he introduced himself as the new immigration head and welcomed the
flight.
</P>
<P>
Chen acknowledged that although immigration is now run by civilians, the
airport remains under U.S. military control.
</P>
<P>
"This is a military zone," he told passengers. "The U.S. Army is in control
here."
</P>
<P>
The airport had been a principal target of U.S. forces when their invasion was
launched Dec. 20.
</P>
<P>
U.S. troops brought the airport under control after heavy fighting, and a
hostage standoff was defused when U.S. forces persuaded Panamanian troops to
release two American women, saying Noriega had been captured.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, as the first commercial flight arrived, there was still evidence of
a strong U.S. military presence.

Armed servicemen met passengers at the door of the airplane. Others were

along the runways, and a U.S. military helicopter hovered nearby while the
Eastern aircraft taxied to the terminal.

AQUINO RESHUFFLES CABINET BUT KEEPS RAMOS;
</P>
<P>
PHILIPPINES: THE SHAKE-UP IS UNLIKELY TO SATISFY THE REBELS OR OTHER CRITICS,
ANALYSTS SAY.

<P>
One month after a coup nearly toppled her from power, President Corazon Aquino
announced sweeping changes in her Cabinet on Sunday, including a new chief of
the nation's much-criticized civilian intelligence services.
</P>
<P>
Aquino removed seven of her 22 Cabinet ministers and moved several others to
new posts. It was the broadest Cabinet shake-up since she assumed power four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
But Aquino did not accede to growing pressure to oust Defense Secretary Fidel
V. Ramos, whose military has now mutinied six times against her government, or
announce new policies to solve the nation's growing social and economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet shake-up came as rebel leaders declared a cease-fire for the New
Year's weekend, ending for the moment nearly daily rumors and press reports of
another coup or assassination attempt. The Dec. 1-9 military revolt left at
least 113 dead and more than 500 wounded.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said much of the Cabinet reshuffle appeared more cosmetic than
substantive. They said it was unlikely to satisfy rebel leaders and military
and civilian critics, who charge that Aquino's administration is corrupt and
inefficient.
</P>
<P>
But Aquino won critical support in a strongly worded pastoral letter that was
read in thousands of churches before millions of parishioners Sunday morning
across Asia's only Roman Catholic country.
</P>
<P>
"The staging of a coup d'etat . . . is a rebellion . . . against God, from whom
all civil authority is derived," the nation's bishops declared in the letter.
"In other words, to seize power through a coup d'etat is a sin."
</P>
<P>
The letter said that the faithful could not stand idly by during a coup, which
it called "a morally neutral stand."
</P>
<P>
The church leaders, led by Manila's archbishop, Cardinal Jaime Sin, conceded
that there is abuse of power, incompetence and graft under Aquino. "Our
government must get its act together," the church leaders warned, calling for
"profound" and "thoroughgoing reforms."
</P>
<P>
In a nationally televised appearance, Aquino said that she reorganized her
Cabinet to "adjust to new situations" and to improve deteriorating government
services.
</P>
<P>
Her spokesman, Adolfo Azcuna, later told reporters that the changes were
"triggered not so much by the coup attempt but by the same reasons that
precipitated the coup attempt. It's something you might say is parallel."
</P>
<P>
Azcuna said the new Cabinet "should be an action team. The time for action is
long overdue."
</P>
<P>
The most significant change appeared to be the sacking of Rodolfo Canieso, who
ran the National Intelligence Coordinating Authority, the Philippine equivalent
of the CIA.
</P>
<P>
Philippine intelligence apparently failed to detect the most recent revolt, in
which an estimated 3,000 heavily armed rebel troops quickly captured the
nation's top military bases and then laid siege to Manila's financial district.
In his defense, Canieso said later that a majority of the armed forces did not
oppose the coup.
</P>
<P>
Before running the intelligence agency, Canieso was commander of the army and
head of a right-wing anti-Communist group. Under his tenure, the army helped
foster dozens of rural vigilante groups who were blamed for hundreds of human
rights abuses, including brutal beatings and deaths.
</P>
<P>
Canieso was replaced with retired Maj. Gen. Mariano Adalem, who also was named
presidential consultant on military affairs. Adalem had commanded the
Philippine army until he was appointed head of the National Casino Authority in
1988.
</P>
<P>
But Aquino did not remove Defense Secretary Ramos or armed forces Chief of
Staff Renato de Villa. Opposition politicians and even some of Aquino's closest
aides had demanded that both be ousted for failing to forestall the latest
military uprising. Ramos was a prime target of the coup attempt, and rebel
leaders have made his removal a key demand.
</P>
<P>
Ramos helped start the initial military-civilian revolt that swept Aquino to
power in 1986. He has been her closest and most trusted military adviser since
then and is considered a front-runner in the 1992 presidential election, when
her term expires.
</P>
<P>
Alex Magno, an associate professor of political science at the University of
the Philippines, said Aquino could not replace Ramos easily, since he is the
only civilian respected by a large segment of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"It might be unwise to make dramatic changes in the military now," Magno said.
"It's not politically feasible. It might disturb a very precarious
equilibrium."
</P>
<P>
Other analysts said that Aquino's failure to remove several key aides was as
noteworthy as the shifts she made. She did not, for example, replace Jose S.
Concepcion Jr., secretary of trade and industry, or Mita Pardo de Tavera, head
of social welfare and development.
</P>
<P>
Concepcion's longtime tenure as trade czar has been marked by widespread
accusations by foreign businessmen and local officials of inefficiency,
incompetence and possible corruption. Concepcion broke into tears several
months ago while defending himself in a congressional hearing, which examined
allegations that his own companies had profited from his official actions.
</P>
<P>
Tavera, who has served in the Cabinet since Aquino came to power, has been
criticized even by Aquino's inner circle for failing to deliver basic social
services in rural provinces.
</P>
<P>
But analysts applauded Aquino's removal of Education Secretary Lourdes
Quisumbing in favor of Isidro Carino, the highly regarded president of
University of the East, one of Manila's largest universities. Quisumbing has
presided over an education system that has seen illiteracy grow, a decline in
the number of schools, a lack of textbooks and other major problems.
</P>
<P>
Aquino also won kudos for replacing Transportation Secretary Rainerio Reyes
with Oscar Orbos, one of the Philippines' most active congressmen and sponsor
of a bill that would boost small business in rural areas. Under Reyes, public
transportation in the capital has deteriorated dramatically in the past year,
with a shortage of buses, rising fares and a series of crippling strikes.
</P>
<P>
Aquino moved her labor secretary, Franklin Drilon, to head the justice
department. He replaces Sedfrey Ordonez, who had vowed to resign if he did not
catch any "big fish" in corruption or organized crime by year's end. Although
he did not succeed, Ordonez was named new ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
With the economy struggling to recover from the coup's bloody fighting, Aquino
replaced both her finance secretary and the head of the central bank. She also
named a new secretary to run the land reform program, which has been plagued by
scandal and charges that the Aquino family sugar cane plantation used a
loophole to avoid distributing land.
</P>
<P>
Aquino also appointed new secretaries for agriculture, economic planning, labor
and a new press secretary. Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, who will head
negotiations on whether to renew leases for U.S. military bases in the
Philippines, was retained.

Several fundamentalist Afghan guerrilla leaders were hanged at a public
gathering inside Afghanistan for murdering about 30 moderate moujahedeen rebels
last summer, a spokesman for the Jamaat-i-Islami guerrilla group said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Fundamentalist Hizb-i-Islami commander Syed Jamal Agha was hanged along with
several other of the group's commanders in Taloqan on Dec. 23, Jamaat-i-Islami
spokesman Umar Sherdil said, confirming reports published Sunday in local
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Sherdil told journalists that Agha and a "few" other Hizb-i-Islami commanders
were publicly hanged in the city's main park in the presence of 43 leading
elders from northern Afghanistan. He said that a large number of people
witnessed the execution.
</P>
<P>
The executions are the latest in a series of assassinations among moujahedeen
guerrillas and politicians in Afghanistan and in refugee camps in Pakistan as
Muslim fundamentalists struggle with moderates for control over the 5 million
Afghan refugees and the rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
A Jamaat-i-Islami member who claimed to have witnessed the executions said Agha
was questioned in the park and accused by many people present of having killed
their relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
The commander reportedly told them that he had killed hundreds of people in the
fighting against Soviet and Soviet-backed Afghanistan government forces and
couldn't identify them.
</P>
<P>
He was also reported to have confessed his role in the murders of about 30
Jamaat-i-Islami commanders and moujahedeen in an ambush last summer.
</P>
<P>
Hizb-i-Islami is a hard-line fundamentalist Afghan guerrilla group seeking to
create an Islamic state in Kabul. Jamaat-i-Islami, while also strongly Islamic,
is more moderate.
</P>
<P>
Hizb-i-Islami has been particularly envious of the charismatic and successful
Jamaat-i-Islami commander, Ahmed Shah Masoud, who was reportedly the target of
the massacre.

SINGAPORE'S PREMIER SAYS HE WILL RETIRE AT END OF 1990

Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who turned a colonial backwater into a modern
industrial giant, announced Sunday that he will step down from the post he has
held for 30 years before the end of 1990.
</P>
<P>
In his New Year's message, the 66-year-old Lee said First Deputy Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong will be his successor, ending speculation that he would
immediately pass the post on to his son, Trade and Industry Minister Lee Hsien
Loong.
</P>
<P>
Lee, the country's first and only prime minister, has made it clear he is not
retiring but has said in the past that he will become a senior Cabinet
minister.
</P>
<P>
Western observers expect he will retain veto power on all critical decisions
and leave the day-to-day running of the country up to his handpicked second
generation of leaders, including his 37-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
Although Goh, 48, has said he expects Lee Hsien Loong to eventually follow him
in the No. 1 job, he ruled out any interim label for himself by making it clear
he expects to run for prime minister in the next election in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Lee Kuan Yew, who has been in control from the time Singapore achieved
self-rule in 1959 and full independence from Britain in 1965, said the country
of 2.6 million residents "enters the 1990s with its people and leaders
confident that they have pulled together when the going got rough, and can do
so again."
</P>
<P>
"For Asia and the Pacific, a sound relationship between America and Japan is
crucial to stability and growth," Lee said. He noted this "may be more
difficult in the future without a common threat from the Soviet Bloc," which
has been swept by democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
He exhorted his countrymen to "let the 1990s be the decade when Singapore comes
of age as a developed country."
</P>
<P>
"It has been a decade of self-renewal," Lee said of the 1980s. "A new
generation has assumed leadership positions in the Cabinet, Parliament and the
public service.
</P>
<P>
"Before the end of 1990, Goh Chok Tong will take over as prime minister," Lee
said, in his most explicit statement yet about relinquishing the prime
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Skeptics, however, recalled that five years ago, Lee indicated he would retire
at 65.

<P>
The city of Fresno filed a $650-million lawsuit against three international
firms that sold the pesticide DBCP that ended up polluting city wells. The
pesticide contamination has forced closure of nearly three-dozen city wells.
</P>
<P>
Cleanup costs could total tens of millions of dollars. City Councilman Craig
Scharton said Friday that he does not believe taxpayers should have to foot the
bill for a mess created by private companies. Named in the suit, which was
filed in San Francisco Superior Court, are Shell Oil, Occidental Petroleum Co.,
Dow Chemical and distributors of the cancer-causing pesticide that was banned
in the late 1970s but is expected to remain in San Joaquin Valley ground water
supplies for the next 50 to 100 years. At least two other San Joaquin Valley
cities, Sanger and Kingsburg, have pending suits against the pesticide
companies dating back six years.

A small earthquake struck 24 miles southwest of Palm Springs. There were no
reports of damage or injury in the magnitude 3.1 temblor, which was in a remote

not related to a series of small temblors that struck last week along the San
Jacinto fault from San Bernardino to east of Palm Springs, Finn said.

Police in San Jose arrested the father of a 3-year-old boy who was jabbed by a
cocaine-filled hypodermic needle while trying to break up a fight between the
parents. David Kennard, 24, was arrested at his home and booked on suspicion of
assault with a deadly weapon.
</P>
<P>
Authorities planned to test him for any diseases that might have been passed to
the boy through the needle. Tests conducted on the boy after he was stuck with
the needle showed no significant amounts of cocaine had entered his system.
Kennard and the boy's mother, Charlene Ann Lemon, were reportedly arguing about
Kennard's cocaine use when the boy tried to stop the dispute, police said.
During the argument, Kennard was waving a syringe and the boy was jabbed in a
finger, officers said.

</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: CLEAN AIR, IMMIGRATION REFORM, VIDEOCASSETTE COPYRIGHT PROTECTION
AND AIDS TESTING ARE OF INTEREST TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

<TEXT>
<P>
Among other items on his sweeping 1990 legislative agenda, Rep. Henry A. Waxman
(D-Los Angeles) aspires to overhaul the Clean Air Act and place stricter limits
on agricultural pesticide residue on fruits and vegetables. He also hopes to
require food manufacturers to provide detailed labeling of products and
scientific support for health claims.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), meanwhile, is seeking immigration
reform that would increase the number of visas for family members of permanent
U.S. residents. He is also sponsoring a bill to ban "black boxes," which are
used to make unauthorized copies of videocassettes.
</P>
<P>
Among his modest legislative goals, Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley)
continues to carry a measure that would empower federal courts to impose the
death sentence for the killing of federal law enforcement officers. The same
proposal failed to move in the last session of Congress.
</P>
<P>
These six measures are a sampling of the 54 diverse bills that the five San
Fernando Valley-area members introduced this year and hope to see enacted in
1990. The proposals generally deal with national issues rather than local
concerns.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, some of the laws -- such as the Clean Air Act, immigration reform,
videocassette copyright protection and Waxman's efforts to provide early
confidential AIDS testing and counseling -- are of particular interest to
Southern Californians.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, these health issues have impact on my constituents as they have on
people throughout the country," said Waxman, whose 24th District includes
Universal City and parts of North Hollywood and Los Feliz as well as the
Beverly-Fairfax area, Hollywood and Hancock Park.
</P>
<P>
The initiatives carried in the 101st Congress by Waxman, Berman, Gallegly and
by Reps. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) and Carlos J. Moorhead
(R-Glendale) reflect the lawmakers' legislative priorities as well as their
place in the Capitol Hill hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
Waxman expects to pass some of his far-reaching bills, although struggles
remain over important specifics; Berman may see provisions of his immigration
bill incorporated into a broad reform package and would like to move other
proposals, and Beilenson hopes that his politically risky measures in favor of
a tax increase and public campaign financing will at least inspire discussion.
</P>
<P>
Moorhead and Gallegly, as members of the Republican minority, face uphill
battles over their narrower legislative priorities.
</P>
<P>
The Valley members' initiatives are among 4,842 measures introduced by House
members in 1989, the first year of the two-year session. Overall, 93 bills and
resolutions have been enacted, which is typical of an institution that tends to
creep along until adjournment approaches and then engages in a lawmaking
frenzy.
</P>
<P>
Even then, most proposals fail to negotiate the legislative labyrinth. Success
often comes by folding the provisions of a bill into a broader measure that
appears headed for passage, persuading senior colleagues to sponsor an
initiative or influencing behind-the-scenes negotiations and policy committee
actions. For Republicans such as Moorhead, this may mean getting a Democrat to
adopt their ideas.
</P>
<P>
And it often takes more than one session of Congress to get something done.
Thus, many of the Valley-area lawmakers' proposals are carried over from
previous sessions when they failed to go anywhere.
</P>
<P>
For the third time, for instance, Beilenson is sponsoring a bill to increase
the federal gasoline tax by 50 cents a gallon over a five-year period to reduce
the federal deficit and another to publicly finance congressional general
election campaigns. For the fourth time, he has reintroduced a measure to
double the safety standard for automobile bumpers.
</P>
<P>
"They're the sort of thing he likes to leave there so people will talk about
it," said a legislative aide to Beilenson.
</P>
<P>
After two unsuccessful attempts to expand patent protection for industrial
designs of such items as luggage, telephones and automobile parts, Moorhead
says that new-found backing by key colleagues and the Bush Administration may
portend passage.
</P>
<P>
"I think we will get it through eventually," Moorhead said last week. "I
wouldn't guarantee this Congress. We're building more and more support for it
all the time."
</P>
<P>
Waxman, a legislative power as chairman of the influential health and
environment subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is
carrying numerous major bills and plans to introduce others.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Clean Air, food labeling, pesticide and AIDS measures, he is
pushing bills to establish standards and routine inspections of fish to detect
chemical contamination; toughen the Food and Drug Administration's oversight of
medical devices; increase the number of community residential programs for the
mentally retarded and authorize Medicaid to pay for home health care for the
poor elderly rather than restricting coverage to nursing home costs.
</P>
<P>
Waxman said last week that he also plans to sponsor a bill to further restrict
cigarette promotion and advertising and sale to minors. Stiff opposition from
the powerful tobacco lobby is expected.
</P>
<P>
This is not unusual. On many of his initiatives, Waxman is opposed by the Bush
Administration as well as by private industry.
</P>
<P>
A senior agriculture official testified in May that Waxman's bill to change the
standard for cancer-causing carcinogenic pesticide residue on food from a
balancing of health and economic concerns to strictly health considerations
would have a disastrous impact on food prices and the food supply. The measure
is one of several introduced in the wake of widespread fears prompted by use of
the chemical Alar on apples.
</P>
<P>
Waxman, in turn, adamantly opposes a pesticide-control bill by the White House
that would tighten registration requirements and stiffen sanctions against
violators but would also prevent states from imposing more stringent pesticide
restrictions. Environmentalists in California are seeking to place a tough
environmental initiative on the 1990 ballot that would phase out all
agricultural chemicals known to cause cancer or reproductive injury by 1996.
</P>
<P>
Waxman's subcommittee chairmanship has allowed him to assemble a large and
respected staff, hold frequent hearings and aggressively pursue a liberal
agenda that includes protecting consumers and fighting for benefits for the
poor, elderly and infirm.
</P>
<P>
He possesses "an instinct for the legislative process that is second to none, a
thorough knowledge of the rules and willingness to exploit every one and a
temperament that is all but unflappable," said the 1988 edition of "The
American Almanac of Politics."
</P>
<P>
Berman, an ally of Waxman's, has established clout on the House Judiciary
Committee, particularly on immigration and copyright issues. As a member of the
Foreign Affairs Committee, he also has become a player on some international
matters.
</P>
<P>
This year, Berman passed a far-reaching bill that prohibits all arms sales,
whether publicly known or covert, to countries placed on a so-called "terrorist
list" by the secretary of state unless the President provides Congress with
prior notice and detailed justification. Berman introduced the measure in
response to the Iran arms sales scandal.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to prevent the spread of ballistic missiles, he also has sponsored
a bill to require the President to impose sanctions against companies that
export missile technology in violation of U.S. export-control laws. Under the
measure, which overwhelmingly passed the House this year, foreign companies
that sell this technology to countries such as Libya or Iraq would face the
prospect of being cut off from U.S. Department of Defense contracts.
</P>
<P>
On immigration, as Congress moves to revise the 24-year-old U.S. visa-allotment
system, Berman is pushing for expansion of visas in general and is championing
the reunification of family members of those who have become permanent U.S.
residents. Berman maintains this should remain the cornerstone of national
immigration policy.
</P>
<P>
Others, however, have sought to shift the overall emphasis toward immigrants'
education and employment skills. This is intended to open the doors for more
Western Europeans, who have been largely shut out by the current system's bias
toward regions with more recent immigrants, who thus have more immediate
relatives in the United States. These regions include parts of Asia and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
Berman is also carrying a bill that he has previously introduced twice. The
measure, sought by the American Civil Liberties Union, would remove the
President's authority to prohibit U.S. citizens from spending money in
countries against which the United States has an economic embargo -- which
effectively prohibits travel to places such as Cuba, Vietnam and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
Berman passed a provision of his original bill last year that eliminated the
ban on exporting and importing informational materials, such as films,
newspapers and books, to and from embargoed countries.
</P>
<P>
Beilenson's significant legislative roles are, by their very nature, low
profile.
</P>
<P>
He sits on the important but largely anonymous House Rules Committee, which
controls the flow of legislation and determines the limits of debate on the
House floor. He is chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence, which provides oversight and approves the budgets for the CIA and
other intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
Beilenson tends to be less of a force on other legislation. His tax and
consumer bills have languished. His proposals to publicly finance congressional
campaigns have earned him renown as an advocate but have not led to any reform
yet.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, such efforts have contributed to Beilenson's reputation as an
independent-minded lawmaker willing to take politically unpalatable positions
that are certain to wind up in election opponents' brochures.
</P>
<P>
Beilenson did win passage last year of a long-sought measure prohibiting the
import of ivory and other pachyderm parts as part of international efforts to
save the threatened African elephant. Under the measure, Congress can earmark
as much as $5 million a year for elephant conservation projects; $300,000 was
appropriated last year. Beilenson plans to ask for $5 million again in the 1990
fiscal year, an aide said, but funding remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
Gallegly, a two-term Republican, has yet to make a legislative mark. None of
the handful of bills he sponsored in his three years has passed.
</P>
<P>
This year, he picked up additional bipartisan support for his measure to
authorize the death penalty for killers of police, judges and other law
enforcement officials. Similar bills had previously stalled in committees but
Gallegly maintained his was more narrowly drawn.
</P>
<P>
He also sponsored a bill to deny federal student financial aid to individuals
convicted of desecrating the American flag. It remains in the House Committee
on Education and Labor.
</P>
<P>
"He concentrated more of his attention to constituent service and building
relationships with other members and familiarizing himself with the process,"
John Frith, Gallegly's spokesman, said of the former Simi Valley mayor's first
term.
</P>
<P>
Now, Frith said, Gallegly's staff is exploring a series of legislative
initiatives that may be introduced next year.
</P>
<P>
These include a resolution putting Congress on record as opposing any
consideration of legalizing drugs and bills to ban the manufacture, sale and
importation of drug paraphernalia; to shift American troops no longer needed in
Europe to Immigration and Naturalization border patrols and to give the
President a line-item budget veto but allow Congress to override a presidential
veto with a majority vote.
</P>
<P>
Moorhead, dean of the California Republican delegation, has introduced a
measure to require customs agents to check the vehicle identification number of
exported automobiles. He said this would cut down on car thefts that involve
changing identification numbers and shipping stolen vehicles overseas.
</P>
<P>
Another Moorhead measure would permit the INS to use volunteers for clerical
and secretarial duties at border patrol offices. This idea, which Moorhead said
was prompted by volunteer programs in Los Angeles law-enforcement agencies, is
intended to alleviate a manpower shortage by putting more professional agents
out on patrol.
</P>
<P>
Neither bill has gained any apparent legislative momentum.
</P>
<P>
In addition to his design patents proposal, Moorhead also has introduced a bill
to provide a process for patenting products developed through space
exploration. He said he is optimistic about its prospects.
</P>
<P>
Beyond his own bills, Moorhead said, he is often involved in shaping
legislation as the ranking Republican on Energy and Commerce's subcommittee on
energy and power and on Judiciary's subcommittee on courts, civil liberties and
administration of justice. The latter assignment has led to his pre-eminent
legislative specialty.
</P>
<P>
"Much of his legislative work has been done on patent and copyright -- useful
but scarcely fascinating matters like protecting American patent rights abroad,
protecting the privacy of electronic mail and extending drug patents to give
time for regulatory approval," according to "The American Almanac of Politics."
</P>
<P>

CONGRESSIONAL BILLS PENDING
</P>
<P>
Some legislation introduced in the 101st Congress by Valley Area
Representatives:
</P>
<P>
REP. ANTHONY C. BEILENSON (D-Tarzana)
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN FINANCING: Bill would publicly and fully finance all general election
campaigns in the House of Representatives. Prospects: Measure failed to move in
two previous sessions; partial public campaign financing considered a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
GASOLINE TAX: Bill would phase in a 50 cents-a-gallon increase in the federal
gasoline tax over five years, raising $150 billion for deficit reduction during
that time. Prospects: Dim, given President Bush's pledge not to increase taxes.
</P>
<P>
REP. HOWARD L. BERMAN (D-Panorama City)
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRATION REFORM: Bill would increase visas for family members of permanent
U.S. residents and for workers. Prospects: Under active consideration; likely
to be merged with other immigration measures.
</P>
<P>
VIDEOCASSETTE COPYRIGHTS: Bill would ban the manufacture and sale of "black
boxes" that facilitate the unauthorized copying of videocassettes. Prospects:
Berman seeking hearing early next year in House Judiciary subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
REP. ELTON GALLEGLY (R-Simi Valley)
</P>
<P>
DEATH PENALTY: Bill would empower federal courts to impose the death penalty
for killing federal law enforcement officers. Prospects: Bottled up in House
Judiciary Committee last session; Senate Judiciary Committee passed broader
capital punishment bill in October.
</P>
<P>
REP. CARLOS J. MOORHEAD (R-Glendale)
</P>
<P>
DESIGN PATENT: Bill would expand copyright protection for industrial designs of
such items as telephones, luggage and automotive parts. Prospects: Moorhead has
unsuccessfully introduced measure in two previous
</P>
<P>
sessions but has new-found congressional and Administration support.
</P>
<P>
AUTO THEFT: Bill would require customs officers to verify identification
numbers of vehicles before the cars are exported to make sure they are not
stolen. Prospects: Uncertain.
</P>
<P>
REP. HENRY A. WAXMAN (D-Los Angeles)
</P>
<P>
CLEAN AIR: Sweeping bill would revise clean air legislation including urban and
rural air pollution guidelines, toxic pollutants restrictions and acid rain
controls. Prospects: Passage of a bill likely but high-stakes battles,
particularly including over on alternative automobile fuels and acid rain
provisions, remain.
</P>
<P>
FOOD LABELING: Bill would require food labels to specify the amount of fat,
cholesterol, sodium, protein and calories and manufacturers to provide
scientific evidence to support health claims. Prospects: Waxman optimistic, but
disagreements remain.
</P>
<P>
PESTICIDE RESIDUE: Bill would change the standard for measuring acceptable
level of pesticide residue on foods from a balancing of health and economic
concerns to strictly health considerations. Prospects: Major fight looms, with
Bush Administration proposing a bill more sympathetic to agriculture and
chemical industries.

</P>
<P>
REMODEL: NEW AGUA DULCE FIREHOUSE BEGAN LIFE AS FAMILY HOME.
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Firefighters assigned to Los Angeles County Fire Station 81 in remote Agua
Dulce find they can do most of their work from home.
</P>
<P>
The home, in this case, is the station itself -- a converted three-bedroom,
ranch-style house on Sierra Highway that serves a 60-square-mile area with a
population of about 4,500. It houses two firefighters, a Fire Department
engineer and a captain, each of whom spends an average of two 24-hour shifts
per week in the cozy quarters.
</P>
<P>
The 2,200-square-foot house was bought by the county in 1986 to replace the
community's aging fire station in nearby Mint Canyon, Fire Department officials
said. It is one of only three such stations operated by the county -- the
others are on Catalina Island and in the city of Walnut, said Randy Gomez,
construction coordinator for the Fire Department. Two other county fire
stations operate out of mobile homes, he said.
</P>
<P>
The house cost the county $250,000 -- about a third of what it might have cost
to build a new station, officials said. The Fire Department spent an additional
$50,000 to remodel the house.
</P>
<P>
It's a nice change from the standard red-brick station, providing relaxation
amid otherwise stressful working conditions, firefighters say.
</P>
<P>
"On a comfort scale of one to 10, this is a 10," said fire engineer Allyn
Holton, who regularly works at a much busier county fire station in Newhall but
occasionally fills in at Station 81 when its engineer has to be away.
</P>
<P>
"It's more like a motel, instead of an army barracks."
</P>
<P>
Fire Department planners built an office for the captain and installed a larger
entrance, a microphone and loudspeakers for radio dispatches and a paper towel
dispenser in the bathroom. But in most respects, the single-story house looks
pretty much the way it did in its domestic state, said Capt. Ted Lindaman, one
of three captains assigned to the station.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters enjoy the luxury of two fireplaces, a bathtub and a large kitchen
with wood-grain cabinets and a built-in microwave oven. They pitched in for a
large-screen television in the living room, and each bedroom has weightlifting
equipment for fitness training. An outdoor satellite dish that came with the
house improves TV reception in the mountainous area, Lindaman said.
</P>
<P>
There isn't much interior decorating to speak of -- the walls are generally
bare except for a large map showing county fire station locations -- and family
mementos have been replaced by a firefighter's first-place award for a local
chili cook-off and a wood plaque that says "The Fighting 81st."
</P>
<P>
The captain and engineer have their own bedrooms, and the two firefighters
share the third bedroom.
</P>
<P>
A total of 12 Fire Department employees are assigned to the station, though
only four occupy the house at any one time due to shift changes, Lindaman said.
</P>
<P>
The house caught the eye of Fire Department planners because its garage had
been built to fit the previous owner's motor home and was large enough for a
fire engine, Lindaman said. Also, a large, corrugated-metal storage shed has
room for four reserve engines that can be put into service throughout the area
if regular engines are being repaired, he said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the station's calls are for auto accidents on Sierra Highway -- an
alternate route to the often congested Antelope Valley Freeway -- and
occasional brush fires. In between, firefighters inspect water tanks for leaks
and make sure that brush has been cleared near homes and businesses, Lindaman
said.
</P>
<P>
The station handled about 400 calls this year, compared with about 3,000 at
Station 73 in Newhall, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The homey atmosphere is nice for some, but others prefer a faster pace,
Lindaman said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a nice station to be at," he said. "But if you're looking for a lot of
action, you want to get out of here. This is not what you would call a fast
firehouse."
</P>
<P>
And despite the remodeling, some of the fixtures just aren't designed for the
kind of wear and tear that fire stations have to endure, Lindaman said. At most
stations, doors are designed to swing so firefighters can quickly exit to
respond to emergencies, but the solid wood doors at Station 81 sometimes lock
when closed, creating hassles when firefighters rush out of the house toward
the fire engine, Lindaman said.
</P>
<P>
"It has its advantages and disadvantages," he said. "This tends to alleviate
some of the stress because of the atmosphere. But it's not really set up to be
a firehouse. The fixtures are meant for a regular family. They're not meant for
12 guys, day in and day out, going in and out."
</P>
<P>
"You have firefighters who are dirty and grimy coming back from fires -- and
the carpet has a tendency to get dirty."
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the station are surprised to find out it's a house, Lindaman said.
</P>
<P>
"People that stop in say 'Boy, this is pretty nice -- just like being at home,'
" he said. "Well, it is, in a way. People have never seen a fire station like
it."

RIVERSIDE TEEN-AGERS HELD AFTER 125-MILE CHASE IN STOLEN CAR
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 14-year-old Riverside boy was arrested early Sunday after leading police on a
125-mile, high-speed chase in a stolen car before finally running out of gas
north of the Santa Clarita Valley, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The youth's 16-year-old girlfriend, a passenger, also was taken into custody
following the chase, which began about 1:45 a.m. in Riverside, said Sgt. Mark
Lunn of the California Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
Riverside police attempted to stop the 1987 blue Mazda 323 after spotting the
stolen vehicle at Washington Street and Overlook Parkway, Lunn said. But the
car sped away, heading north on Washington Street, Lunn said.
</P>
<P>
The pursuit continued to the westbound Riverside Freeway, where the California
Highway Patrol took over the chase, which proceeded north on the Santa Ana
Freeway at speeds of up to 110 m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
The chase continued through the San Fernando Valley and into the Santa Clarita
Valley, where the couple left the freeway and headed west on Templin Highway,
then north on The Old Road before running out of gas about 3 a.m., Lunn said.
</P>
<P>
The two were arrested on suspicion of grand theft auto, possessing stolen
property, evading arrest, being a minor in possession of alcohol and for not
wearing seat belts, Lunn said. The boy also was arrested on suspicion of being
an unlicensed driver, Lunn said.
</P>
<P>
The boy told authorities that he stole the car before picking up his girlfriend
at her Riverside home to go for a ride, Lunn said.
</P>
<P>
The youths, whose names were withheld because of their ages, are being held at
Sylmar Juvenile Hall, he said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PACOIMA WOMAN SAVED FROM EMPTY CESSPOOL
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pacoima woman was rescued by Los Angeles firefighters Sunday after she fell
20 feet into an empty cesspool, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Rudy Esquivel, 26, fell into the cesspool in the 8500 block of North Cayuga
Avenue about 12:45 p.m., said Pat Marek, spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire
Department. The underground catch basin near Esquivel's home had been opened by
Los Angeles city workers for repairs, Marek said.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear how the accident occurred, he said.
</P>
<P>
Esquivel suffered minor injuries and was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in
Mission Hills, where she was treated and released, a hospital spokeswoman said.

RAMS HAVE THE LAST WORD, 21-7;
</P>
<P>
NFC PLAYOFFS: L.A. OFFENSE SCORES ON FIRST TWO POSSESSIONS AND ALL-ZONE DEFENSE
SHUTS DOWN CUNNINGHAM AND EAGLES.
</P>

PHILADELPHIA
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one ever said Buddy Ryan's team couldn't talk. Like coach, like team. The
Philadelphia Eagles passed out opinions last week like business cards.
</P>
<P>
Zone defense? If the Rams were sissies enough to try it, fine -- it's their
reputations on the line down at the rifle club.
</P>
<P>
The Eagles' defensive line? Couldn't be stopped. They'd swat the Rams from
their path like moths from a doorstep. Super Bowl, here we come.
</P>
<P>
Travel plans? If needed, the Eagles would be sunning in Santa Rosa this week in
preparation for next week's divisional playoff game against San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
"They can go ahead and plan that flight to Frisco," Ram quarterback Jim Everett
said, "but they ain't going."
</P>
<P>
Not representing the league, anyway. The Rams ruined some great pregame
material for round two with a 21-7 wild-card victory over the Eagles at
Veterans Stadium on Sunday, earning a spot in next week's divisional game
against the New York Giants in the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
Not much to talk about, really. The Rams scored two touchdowns in the first
eight minutes, could have scored two more in the next eight but didn't, then
held on in typical hair-raising fashion, needing two Greg Bell bursts in the
final five minutes to clinch it.
</P>
<P>
Over Ryan's protestations about the sins of zone defense, the Rams proceeded
with their coverage of Eagle quarterback Randall Cunningham. He was to them a
blip on their radar screen, never to be lost from tracking.
</P>
<P>
Unsporting as it seemed, the Rams played not a single down of man-to-man
defense against the Eagles. Theirs was more a quarantine approach of patience
and containment, and it worked well enough to hold Cunningham to 39 rushing
yards and no touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
Ryan said last week that any quarterback worth his salt could undress a zone.
Sunday, he could only tip his cap to Ram defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur,
who had caged Cunningham with nets, not bullets.
</P>
<P>
On this subject, you might say Shurmur and Ryan, another defensive strategist,
have differing opinions.
</P>
<P>
"I disagree like hell with it," Shurmur said of Ryan's attack philosophy.
"Physical is not described in terms of man-to-man or pass rush. Our guys are as
tough as any group I've been around. These guys have been criticized,
chastised; people have said what's a defense that's 21st in the league doing in
the playoffs, all of those things. I think this was a great opportunity for
them to show the world that, hey, we can play this game however you want to
play it."
</P>
<P>
On the flip side of scrimmage, the Rams' offensive line kept the heat off
Everett. The Eagles' sack team of Reggie White and Jerome Brown bagged Everett
one time each, but it wasn't the menacing rush of doom that had been predicted.
</P>
<P>
Tackle Jackie Slater said the line has never been better prepared, and worked
in uncommon unison to pick up stunts and blitzes.
</P>
<P>
The line held the Eagles in check -- without holding any Eagles. The lone Ram
penalty in the game, in fact, was a self-induced delay call to proffer a better
end-zone angle for punter Dale Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
Ram Coach John Robinson considered his line's work commendable, given the task
at hand.
</P>
<P>
"Their line is very famous," he said mockingly of the Eagles' front four. "But
they clearly had their hands full with our offensive line. You might call it a
standoff."
</P>
<P>
You might call it that; Robinson wasn't.
</P>
<P>
"You get to vote," he said. "But I thought we won. They said they were going to
win the battle. I don't think they did."
</P>
<P>
The Eagles' arrogance, born of their coach, rubbed many Rams the wrong way.
Even the team's most guarded diplomat, Everett, admitted he took some of last
week's Eagle chatter into the huddle.
</P>
<P>
Greg Bell said he was taunted throughout the game by Eagles' safety Andre
Waters, who jarred the ball from Bell's arms on a first-down carry at the
Eagles' five in the first quarter, a crucial fumble considering the Rams could
have moved ahead, 21-0, with a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
"He just talked the whole game," Bell said of Waters. "It got to be kind of
funny. He kept saying 'Four-two (Bell's number), I'm going to get you.' And he
got me."
</P>
<P>
Bell redeemed himself later, with the Rams clinging to a seven-point lead in
the fourth quarter. Pinned at their own 16 with 5:44 left, the Rams craved a
possession drive to work time off the clock. They kept the drive alive on third
and four at their 21 on a 15-yard pass from Everett to Buford McGee. On second
down from the 36, Bell took a handoff and broke the play outside.
</P>
<P>
Bell: "Sometimes they spend too much time thinking about what to say, and they
don't think about what their assignments are."
</P>
<P>
Bell broke free down the left sideline and ran 54 yards before being dragged
down by Izel Jenkins at the 10.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I was flying down the field as fast as Bo Jackson would," Bell
said, "but I was getting down the field. I knew he was back there, because I'd
seen him when I took off. He wasted a lot of time trying to strip me (of the
ball), rather than trip me up."
</P>
<P>
Jenkins did strip the ball, but Bell was able grab the ball with his other hand
before going down.
</P>
<P>
Bell ran three yards on first down and then scored the game-clincher from seven
yards out with 2:14 left, putting the Rams up, 21-7.
</P>
<P>
He couldn't top last week's 210-yard performance against New England, but this
wasn't the Patriots' defense, either. Bell finished with 124 yards in 27
carries, which was plenty good enough for Robinson.
</P>
<P>
"Greg Bell had an outstanding game," Robinson said. "That was a slippery, wet,
treacherous set of circumstances."
</P>
<P>
Bell said the Eagles, a gambling defense by nature, gambled one time too many
on his long run. He said it was only a matter of time before a big play popped.
</P>
<P>
"I knew our line was more dominant than theirs because they were trying so many
stunts," he said. "If a team stunts a lot, it tells you one thing: they can't
beat you straight, so they've got to try and finesse their way. And they
weren't capable of doing it."
</P>
<P>
So, Ram fans live to suffer another day. The Rams dominated the Eagles
throughout, but still needed a fourth-quarter surge to protect the win.
</P>
<P>
Robinson was almost indignant when asked how such a thing could happen.
</P>
<P>
"This is the way this team has played all year," he said. "We screw up. That's
us."
</P>
<P>
It took the Rams five plays to score on their first possession, Everett
throwing a wobbly, underthrown pass to receiver Henry Ellard, who was rewarded
for jumping higher than safety Jenkins by pulling down the reception at about
the 20 and strolling in for a 39-yard touchdown pass play.
</P>
<P>
After a 30-yard Eagles' punt on their first possession, the Rams marched 46
yards in seven plays for another touchdown, the score coming on a four-yard
pass from Everett to Damone Johnson.
</P>
<P>
The Rams might have been cruising at halftime if not for Bell's fumble inside
the five; a 47-yard field goal attempt by Mike Lansford that went awry, and an
Everett interception late in the half after the Rams had earned first-and-10 at
the Eagles' 25.
</P>
<P>
The unenlightened might see the squandering of such opportunities as wasteful,
or nerve-wracking.
</P>
<P>
"We have character," tackle Irv Pankey said. "We don't put up a facade of
character, you see what I'm saying? We've got character."
</P>
<P>
With Sunday's win, the Rams also have a chance, and a funny feeling.
</P>
<P>
"It's growing on us," Everett said. "It's like the Rams can get there."
</P>
<P>
And the Eagles can't.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes

coordinator Fritz Shurmur is expected to be among those considered for the
Cardinals' job. . . . Both sacks of Cunningham were made by linebacker Kevin
Greene. . . . Add Cunningham: His only punt of the game traveled just 20 yards.

RAMS GOT DEFENSIVE ABOUT IT
</P>

PHILADELPHIA

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The poor guy was just trying to do his job, revving up a grounds-crew truck
outside the Ram locker room, and there was John Robinson's red face, screaming
at him.
</P>
<P>
"Either move it in or move it out," Robinson yelled at the driver. "We can't
get anything done with that going."
</P>
<P>
Upon command, the rumbling truck shifted into reverse and retreated around the
corner, out of earshot, giving Robinson the space he needed to conduct his
postgame rap session.
</P>
<P>
The coach looked pleased.
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," he said, puffing out his chest. "We're tough guys."
</P>
<P>
If you thought the Rams were defensive during Sunday's 21-7 wild-card victory
over Philadelphia, you should have heard them in the aftermath. Under Ram horns
sits some extremely thin skin, along with ears that burned all week, on both
coasts.
</P>
<P>
This is what the Rams heard, or what they thought they heard:
</P>
<P>
(a) They're too soft.
</P>
<P>
(b) They can't play in the cold.
</P>
<P>
(c) They can't play in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
(d) They can't play a lick of defense.
</P>
<P>
Robinson swears he heard it.
</P>
<P>
"People are always on us -- we don't play enough man-to-man, we don't rush the
passer, we're stupid, we don't know how to coach," he said.
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jim Everett swears he heard it.
</P>
<P>
"How many shows did I watch in Philadelphia talking about the Eagles going to
San Francisco?" he said.
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Kevin Greene swears he heard it.
</P>
<P>
"We read stuff about the warm weather, the beach boys from L.A.," he said. "And
I don't like it."
</P>
<P>
Basically, it took three Philadelphia quotes to set the Rams off. The first had
Eagle Coach Buddy Ryan calling the Ram defense the worst in the playoffs. True,
but unkind. The second also came from Ryan, claiming the Eagles were good
enough to beat the 49ers, which presumed the Eagles already had the Rams
beaten.
</P>
<P>
The third came from Mike Schad, the Ram washout who now starts for
Philadelphia. Schad forecast an Eagle victory because the Rams weren't physical
enough up front and, basically, were about to get head-butted all over Veterans
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
"We heard all of it," Everett said. "We took a lot of pregame abuse. That comes
with the territory, I guess, when you play Philly and Buddy Ryan.
</P>
<P>
"They gave us a lot of motivation. We had the locker-room material. They gave
it to us. That's the way they play, that's fine.
</P>
<P>
"They deserved everything they got today."
</P>
<P>
So Sunday was a day for the Rams to break a few myths, although, as with most
stereotypes, some of them were grounded in fact.
</P>
<P>
Fact: Before Sunday, the Rams were 2-5 in playoff games this decade. Robinson's
only postseason victories had come against the Dallas Cowboys -- in 1983 and
1985.
</P>
<P>
Fact: Before Sunday, the Rams were winless in cold-weather playoff sites this
decade, losing twice at Washington and again at Chicago in the 1985 NFC
championship game.
</P>
<P>
Fact: The Rams' defense did rank 21st in the NFL this season -- a dead-last
28th against the pass.
</P>
<P>
Consider Ram cornerback LeRoy Irvin a fact-checker.
</P>
<P>
"Look at the standings, look at the ratings," Irvin said. "We do have the worst
defense in the playoffs. No doubt about it."
</P>
<P>
And the worst defense in the playoffs holds Randall Cunningham to seven points.
</P>
<P>
"Not bad for a bunch of hacks," Irvin noted.
</P>
<P>
Irvin wasn't, however, as ready to support the cold-war theory.
</P>
<P>
"They said we couldn't win in the cold? Why?" Irvin said. "Because we lost to
Chicago when they were the most dominant team in the entire league?
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how they can say that. I'm from Kansas, Mel Owens is from
Michigan, Vince Newsome is from Washington. We've got guys who've played in
cold weather their entire college careers."
</P>
<P>
Including running back Greg Bell, late of Notre Dame and the Buffalo Bills, who
gets downright indignant over the topic.
</P>
<P>
"People are always writing we have trouble with the cold weather," Bell said.
"That's nothing new. I've been written off for the last six years. I've been
out of the league for six years. I'm still reading that I'm a malingerer,
although I don't see it and John Robinson doesn't see it.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see us blinking in the cold weather today. But that won't change what
people write about us."
</P>
<P>
It's amazing the Rams moved as well as they did in the Pennsylvania rain,
considering the persecution complex they carried with them.
</P>
<P>
But, whatever gets you through the wild-card round. If Rams had to believe that
the world was out to get them in order to band together against the Eagles,
then fine, there may be a future in paranoid power after all.
</P>
<P>
If Everett found the going a little too slippery when wet -- he was intercepted
twice -- the Ram defense and offensive line performed at peak capacity. When
Philadelphia had the football, the Rams yielded but three first downs in the
first half, sacked Cunningham twice and held the Eagles scoreless through three
quarters. When the Rams had the ball, the hard-rushing Philadelphia front was
neutralized, resulting in 409 net Ram yards, sleet or no sleet.
</P>
<P>
"We physically controlled the football game," said Robinson, delighting in each
syllable. "Their defensive line is to be congratulated; they're famous. I don't
want to call it a standoff, but we controlled the line of scrimmage. Their
defensive line clearly had their hands full."
</P>
<P>
Or, as Everett gleefully pointed out, "We might live close to Hollywood, but we
still know how to play football."
</P>
<P>
Ram football.
</P>
<P>
Ram tough.

STEELERS GIVE OILERS THE BOOT IN OVERTIME
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HOUSTON
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It began as a comedy of errors, and although both teams played 15 minutes of
pretty good football in the fourth quarter, it ended with another big error in
overtime -- a fumble that led the Pittsburgh Steelers to a 26-23 upset victory
over the Houston Oilers Sunday at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Houston halfback Lorenzo White fumbled a kickoff in the end
zone before picking the ball up and running it out to the five-yard line. This
is a mistake that few high school backs make.
</P>
<P>
In overtime, on the Oilers' first play after the Steelers had won the toss but
failed to make a first down, White fumbled again.
</P>
<P>
This time, Pittsburgh got it on the Oiler 46, made one first down, then called
in Gary Anderson to kick the seventh 50-yard field goal of his career for the
winning points of the day's second NFL wild-card game.
</P>
<P>
It was his fourth field goal of a ragged, sometimes badly played game that was
full of dropped passes, mishandled punts, false starts and wasted big plays.
</P>
<P>
Anderson's kicking, however, was errorless, putting the Steelers in Denver for
next weekend's second-round match with the favored Broncos.
</P>
<P>
"It can go unsaid that our football team is on the way up," Pittsburgh Coach
Chuck Noll said afterward. "Playoff time is fun time. That's what you work for
all year."
</P>
<P>
Houston Coach Jerry Glanville, who usually has a lot to say, said: "There
really isn't much to say."
</P>
<P>
Anderson's big kick put Glanville's team away despite a strong comeback
performance by Oiler quarterback Warren Moon, who took charge in the fourth
period after Pittsburgh had led after the first 15 minutes, 7-0, at halftime,
10-6, and after one series of the fourth period, 16-9.
</P>
<P>
At that point -- after the Oilers had made only one first down in the third
quarter -- Moon finally got them moving with two impressive drives ending in
touchdown passes to wide receiver Ernest Givins.
</P>
<P>
And now, after slumbering most of the afternoon, Houston was ahead, 23-16.
</P>
<P>
It didn't last. As a crowd of Houston partisans swept the Steelers with noisy
jeers, they marched 82 yards to get even in regulation time, 23-23, before
winning it in the fifth minute of overtime.
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh quarterback Bubby Brister was the triggerman for the Steelers on the
two touchdown drives they managed in the midst of Anderson's kicking exhibition
-- an exhibition in which he improved steadily as the day wore on with field
goals of 25, 30, 48 and 50 yards.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Brister's poise -- in only his second season as a starter -- was
eventually the difference. But it was the coaching of Noll that made everything
possible for the Steelers, who moved to their first touchdown with
well-rehearsed, old-fashioned plays -- a Statue of Liberty run and a
quick-pitch end run, both by rookie running back Tim Worley.
</P>
<P>
In the opening minutes, after the Steelers blocked Houston's first punt at the
Oiler 32, Noll's first call was the statue, which produced 13 yards. His last
call was the pitch to Worley for the nine-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
In the old days, the NFL's better teams often relied on the quick pitch, which
requires a big, fast back with the moves to cut around the defensive line
without any help from pulling blockers.
</P>
<P>
Noll, who has been around awhile, brought it back at the right time and place,
and Worley made it go as well as Bobby Mitchell used to for Cleveland when
Browns' opponents were keying on Jim Brown.
</P>
<P>
The game-tying Pittsburgh touchdown drive in the fourth quarter was another
Noll masterpiece. At all times, he made sure to keep the pressure off Brister,
who was asked to throw nothing longer than 10 yards, and who was assisted at a
timely moment by an end-around run by wide receiver Dwight Stone gaining 22
yards to the Houston 29.
</P>
<P>
From there, the Steelers hammered in the tying touchdown on six runs by their
big backs, Worley and Merril Hoge, through a Houston line that had been
devastated by injuries. By then, three of the Oilers' most useful defensive
linemen, Ray Childress, Doug Smith and Richard Byrd, were all out.
</P>
<P>
Noll's most successful call on that last drive, the one that probably won him
the game, was Hoge's nine-yard draw play to the one-yard line.
</P>
<P>
And so a sharp, old NFL coach, Noll, combined with some sharp new Steelers --
Brister, Worley, Hoge and tight end Mike Mularkey, among others, to end another
dream for Houston Coach Glanville.
</P>
<P>
To most of the 58,306 watching in the oldest of the domed stadiums, Glanville
appeared to have brought in the better offensive players -- Moon, Givins, wide
receiver Drew Hill and four rotating backs, the best of whom is halfback Allen
Pinkett.
</P>
<P>
But as an offensive team, the problem with the Oilers is that their running
offense is based on power and their pass offense on the run-and-shoot.
</P>
<P>
You can usually tell what they're going to do by the way they line up. When
their four little receivers are on the field, it's hard for them to fake a pass
and succeed with a power run.
</P>
<P>
Conversely, they don't effectively pass after faking a run.
</P>
<P>
Good football teams normally run to set up the pass -- as Washington and even
San Francisco often do -- or they pass to set up the run, as Detroit does in
its run-and-shoot offense.
</P>
<P>
But the Oilers don't do either. And in the overtime period, after their
defensive team had stopped Pittsburgh at the outset, Glanville had to make a
decision: Should he send in the pass-offense race horses or the power backs?
</P>
<P>
After thinking it over a moment, he called for the power. But on first down, he
gave the ball to White, an East-West runner with some moves who often fails to
cut forward at the appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
On the biggest play of the game, he was still sliding laterally when cornerback
Rod Woodson came up and separated him from the ball.
</P>
<P>
When White fumbled, the New Year's party was almost over for the Oilers. On
Pittsburgh's first play after recovering the fumble, Noll went back to his
trap-blocking offense -- he is one of the few favoring this style of attack as
an everyday staple -- and got 11 yards from Hoge.
</P>
<P>
That was enough for Anderson.

Boulder, Colo., schoolteachers Bill and Cheryl Dennler say they have learned
their lesson.
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 4, Bill Dennler watched elated fans topple the goal post at Folsom
Field in Boulder after Colorado beat Nebraska, in effect assuring the Buffaloes
of a trip to the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
The Dennlers took out a second mortgage on their home to finance sales of
slices of the goal post, mounted on a wooden base with the CU logo, for $59.95.
They obtained the goal post from the university, which is to receive 10% of any
profits.
</P>
<P>
But there apparently won't be any.
</P>
<P>
The Dennlers' family room is stacked with about 400 plaques. "We've only sold
about 50 of them," Cheryl Dennler said. "We've learned a lot about marketing.
We've learned that we're not salespeople. We'll never do it again."
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Rookie Tony Mandarich of the Green Bay Packers, the first
offensive lineman taken in the NFL draft, did not start a game this season. Who
was the last offensive lineman to be chosen first and not start a game during
his rookie season?
</P>
<P>
Part of a tradition: Carmen Cozza, Yale's football coach, recalled being an
assistant at Miami of Ohio in 1963 when head coach John Pont left for Yale.
Cozza was beaten out for the Miami job by another assistant, Bo Schembechler,
who will coach his final game for Michigan today. Cozza, a Cleveland native,
took over at Yale when Pont became coach at Indiana.
</P>
<P>
Any regrets after 25 years at Yale? Cozza told Joe Concannon of the Boston
Globe: "I came from a country school to a school surrounded by a city. It was a
different experience. I didn't realize the beauty of this place until I started
walking through the courtyards, and I realized football as we know it today
really started here. I've never wanted to leave."
</P>
<P>
Grass is greener: Alan Page, Hall of Fame defensive end for the Minnesota
Vikings and Chicago Bears, on playing on artificial turf: "I suppose you could
say it was novel, at the beginning. But at the time, I was playing on good
fields and ice fields and fields with no grass on them. This was another
variation for the list. But it was at the bottom of the list."
</P>
<P>
A sore winner: Lee Remmel, the Green Bay Packers' publicity director, on being
a reporter during Coach Vince Lombardi's era: "When he was winning, (Lombardi)
was very arrogant answering questions. When he lost, he had a certain amount of
humility and was easy to talk to. But then Vince never had a losing season."
</P>
<P>
Living the concept: Former Raider linebacker Matt Millen has a chance for a
third Super Bowl ring, this time as a San Francisco 49er. Millen on his former
team: "When you would watch them the last few years, you'd look at No. 55 and
say, 'That's what a Raider is.' Am I wrong or right? I epitomized it."
</P>
<P>
Letter head: Reliever Mark Davis, on being reunited with former Padre teammate
Storm Davis on the Kansas City Royals' staff: "My back was getting to feel a
little light without the 'M' on my uniform."
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Ken Huff of the 1975 Baltimore Colts.

AFTER YEARS OF WINNING, HATFIELD WORRIED ABOUT THE WORDING;
</P>
<P>
COTTON BOWL: ARKANSAS COACH FUSSING OVER CONTRACT BEFORE FACING TENNESSEE IN
SECOND CONSECUTIVE TRIP TO DALLAS.
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANNY ROBBINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>

<P>
DALLAS
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In six seasons as head football coach at the University of Arkansas, his alma
mater, Ken Hatfield has compiled a record of 55-16-1, the best winning
percentage (.771) of any coach in school history. What's more, he has survived
the '80s without the taint of NCAA probation, which, given the state of the
Southwest Conference during the last decade, is practically a Man Bites Dog
story.
</P>
<P>
Lou Holtz, Hatfield's predecessor at Arkansas, took the Razorbacks to six
different bowl games during his seven years at the school, but never got them
to the Cotton Bowl. Today, under Hatfield, the 10th-ranked Razorbacks (10-1)
will make their second consecutive Cotton Bowl appearance, meeting
eighth-ranked Tennessee (10-1). The game marks the first time Arkansas has
appeared in back-to-back Cotton Bowls since 1965-66.
</P>
<P>
But, even with these accomplishments, Hatfield doesn't rest easy, and a new
contract, offered to him a year ago, remains on his desk in Fayetteville, Ark.,
unsigned.
</P>
<P>
"There are a couple of little wording things in there that I don't think are
right," he said, "and I'm not going to sign it as long as they're wrong.
</P>
<P>
" . . . It's a difference of opinion. At this point, we have not resolved it.
But I love Arkansas. It's my state. We've won there. We're recruiting well
there."
</P>
<P>
But will they love him tomorrow?
</P>
<P>
When Hatfield replaced Holtz, ousted after a 6-5 season, the move was hailed as
a native son returning to his roots. Hatfield, coming off a five-year run as
head coach at Air Force, had grown up in Helena, Ark., and played defensive
back for the Razorbacks. His 81-yard punt return for a touchdown helped
Arkansas beat Texas, 14-13, in 1964, the year the Razorbacks went 11-0 and won
the national championship. Razorback fans, weary of Holtz's jokes and excuses,
were ready for the change.
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long, however, before the school's fickle following turned on
Hatfield. His offense, a wishbone derivative known as the flexbone, was roundly
knocked for being unimaginative and boring. Hatfield's personal style also drew
criticism. He was said to be too preachy, too open with his religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Hatfield sentiment reached a crescendo in 1987 when the Razorbacks,
picked to win the SWC, finished tied for second. And as that season wound down,
Arkansas Athletic Director Frank Broyles, the man who had coached Hatfield and
then hired him 19 years later, joined the chorus, saying publicly that Hatfield
needed to open up personally -- be more willing to explain his actions to
Arkansas fans -- and open up his offense as well.
</P>
<P>
Under these pressurized conditions, the Razorbacks won the '88 SWC championship
outright and earned the school's first Cotton Bowl trip in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
At the end of that season, Hatfield was offered a new contract, but he declined
to sign it. There was speculation before Arkansas' Cotton Bowl meeting with
UCLA that Hatfield was headed for Georgia to replace the retiring Vince Dooley.
Hatfield did not dispel that speculation, then later said the talk linking him
to the job was enough of a distraction to contribute to his team's 17-3 loss to
the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
Said Broyles: "As a reward for a great ('88) season, he got a new five-year
contract, a big raise and raises for his coaches. I did that way before the
Cotton Bowl. Then he looks at it, and he wants a big . . . Well, his lawyer
wants a big definitive contract rather than just what faculty and Holtz and
(former Arkansas basketball Coach Eddie) Sutton and Broyles and others had. So
we write up a big definitive contract for him."
</P>
<P>
Definitive? "Meaning everything a lawyer can think of," Broyles said. "Thirteen
pages."
</P>
<P>
Broyles says he is "totally confident" with Hatfield in charge of the football
program, although they are not close personally.
</P>
<P>
Said Broyles: "We have nothing in common off the field, because he does certain
things like . . . Well, I play golf. He plays tennis and other things. When I'm
not at the office or at home, I'm playing golf. But I don't think I would want
to be personal friends with the people who work under me, as a rule. I just
don't think that's wise. But Ken and I are professional friends."
</P>
<P>
Hatfield on Broyles: "My relationship with him is something that's been
different ever since I've been back at the University of Arkansas. But, hey,
he's doing a good job. As an athletic director, he's doing a tremendous job."
</P>
<P>
Still, it's plain that these two are on different pages philosophically.
</P>
<P>
According to Broyles, a college football coach nowadays has to do more than
simply win. He must win with the sort of flair that will keep the stadium full
and the contributions flowing.
</P>
<P>
Said Broyles: "The day Lou Holtz walked in, I said, 'You've got to sell out the
stadium, do whatever it takes to sell out the stadium.' And he did. He knew
that. I think any coach knows that."
</P>
<P>
Hatfield may know it, but he doesn't buy into it. He did dump his flexbone this
season in favor of the I-formation. But Hatfield remains a ground-oriented
coach. The Razorbacks actually threw the ball less in '89 than they did in '88.
</P>
<P>
Hatfield on offense: "Too many of the commentators doing football on television
are pro-oriented or come from the pro ranks. They think you've got to throw the
ball every down. . . . The game is changing a little bit, but the media people
have made it like if you don't pass, you're no good. A fullback who carries the
ball is not thought of as highly as a receiver who makes a splashy, spectacular
catch. And yet I love that fullback who's got a momma and daddy just like
everybody else."
</P>
<P>
So, what does Ken Hatfield want?
</P>
<P>
"I don't know yet," he said. "I mean, I know what I want, but that's something
that the administration, myself and so forth are going to have to talk about
after Jan. 1."

NEBRASKA'S GDOWSKI IMPRESSES THE PEOPLE WHO COUNT THE MOST;
</P>
<P>
FIESTA BOWL: CORNHUSKER QUARTERBACK, THE COACHES' CHOICE, LEADS TEAM AGAINST
FLORIDA STATE.

<P>
Unlike Florida State's Peter Tom Willis, his lankier counterpart in today's
Fiesta Bowl game, Nebraska quarterback Gerry Gdowski probably won't attract
much attention from NFL scouts.
</P>
<P>
A year from now, the 6-foot, 190-pound Academic All-American might well be back
home in Fremont, Neb., balancing books as an accountant.
</P>
<P>
Like Willis, though, Gdowski will look back fondly on a senior season in which
he was nothing short of spectacular in his only chance to be a collegiate
starter, putting up the kind of numbers that made fans and the media wonder
where he had been hiding for three years.
</P>
<P>
According to his coach, Tom Osborne, no Nebraska quarterback has ever played
the position any better than Gdowski.
</P>
<P>
And yet, he remains almost as unknown as he was last August.
</P>
<P>
An understudy for two years behind All-Big Eight quarterback Steve Taylor, a
three-year starter for the Cornhuskers, Gdowski emerged from Taylor's shadow
only to be eclipsed this season by Colorado's spectacular Darian Hagan, who led
the Buffaloes to the Big Eight championship, an unbeaten regular season, an
Orange Bowl date against Notre Dame and the top of the polls.
</P>
<P>
But when it came time for the Big Eight coaches to select an all-conference
quarterback, the name they chose was Gerry Gdowski.
</P>
<P>
The media chose Hagan.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the coaches found these numbers hard to ignore:
</P>
<P>
 -- While Hagan passed for 1,002 yards and ran for 1,004 to become only the
fifth player in major college history to both pass and run for more than 1,000
yards in the same season, Gdowski passed for 1,326 and ran for 925 in 69 fewer
attempts than Hagan, averaging 7.9 yards a carry to Hagan's 5.4.
</P>
<P>
"When you figure that he's going to run some quarterback sneaks and he's going
to get sacked a few times, it's really remarkable for a quarterback to average
(almost) eight yards a carry," Osborne said. "I'd say that's probably the most
significant of his statistics."
</P>
<P>
It is not, however, the only one that stands out.
</P>
<P>
Some others:
</P>
<P>
 -- Gdowski averaged 204.6 total yards a game, which was superior to Hagan's
average of 182.4 and established a Cornhusker record.
</P>
<P>
 -- While Hagan accounted for 21 touchdowns, including 17 by rushing, Gdowski
accounted for 32 total and 19 through the air, one every seven pass attempts
and only one short of Vince Ferragamo's school record.
</P>
<P>
 -- Gdowski threw only two interceptions in 136 pass attempts, none in his last
92, and accumulated a passing efficiency rating of 177.3, which would have
surpassed Jim McMahon's NCAA record of 176.9 if Gdowski had attempted the
required 15 passes a game instead of only 12.4.
</P>
<P>
"Amazing," Kansas Coach Glen Mason said of the numbers.
</P>
<P>
Still, outside his football-crazed home state and the projection rooms of
Cornhusker opponents, Gdowski is widely unrecognized.
</P>
<P>
Much of the reason for that, it seems, is that despite a 10-1 record and No. 6
national ranking, the Cornhuskers were under-publicized this season, especially
for a team that earned its 21st straight bowl bid.
</P>
<P>
None of Nebraska's powder-puff nonconference schedule, which included games
against Northern Illinois, Utah, Minnesota and Oregon State, was televised by
the networks or ESPN. Neither were the Cornhuskers' Big Eight games against
Oklahoma and Oklahoma State because those teams, sanctioned by the NCAA,
couldn't appear on television this season.
</P>
<P>
And Nebraska hardly made the most of its only national TV appearance, losing to
Colorado in a showdown for the Big Eight title.
</P>
<P>
But even that doesn't explain Gdowski's lack of recognition.
</P>
<P>
While Hagan passed for only 22 yards and ran for 86 and a touchdown, accounting
for 108 total yards in Colorado's 27-21 victory over the Cornhuskers, Gdowski
ran for 69 yards in 14 fewer carries and passed for 211 yards and three
touchdowns, accounting for 280 total yards against a defense that allowed only
300 yards a game.
</P>
<P>
It's understandable, then, that when asked what he hoped to get out of today's
game, Gdowski said: "I guess maybe a little respect."
</P>
<P>
Though he averaged 8.2 yards a carry in 35 rushing attempts as a sophomore and
junior, Gdowski gave little indication of his passing prowess, throwing for
only 72 yards in two seasons after connecting on only 32.6% of his attempts
three years ago as a starter on the freshman team.
</P>
<P>
"I had probably a better year than I could have imagined," said Gdowski, who
would have a year of eligibility remaining if he had redshirted as a sophomore
instead of spending the season third on the depth chart.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, even Gdowski didn't anticipate his emergence.
</P>
<P>
"I was going to be the third-team quarterback and I was going to have a chance
to play a little bit and travel with the team," he said of his decision not to
redshirt. "Plus, I knew I could graduate in four years. I thought it would be
better just to get on with things.
</P>
<P>
"If I could have looked into the future and known I was going to have a year
like this, I would have liked to redshirt. But I'm happy with the way things
turned out. I don't regret anything."

No. 9 Auburn, which finished the regular season with a five-game winning
streak, faces No. 21 Ohio State, which won six of seven games after a 2-2
start, today for the first time since 1917 in the Hall of Fame Bowl game.
</P>
<P>
The Tigers (9-2) are eight-point favorites over the Buckeyes (8-3), but Auburn
Coach Pat Dye is wary of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
"Being an underdog has been a motivating factor for them every day for a
month," said Dye.
</P>
<P>
The Buckeyes, playing in a bowl game for the first time in three years, led the
Big Ten in offense and scoring, utilizing the kind of balanced attack that gave
Auburn problems in a midseason loss to Florida State.
</P>
<P>
Ohio State Coach John Cooper is concerned about Auburn's defense, which held
opponents to 268.7 yards and 10.6 points and will counter the Buckeyes' size
(Ohio State's offensive line averages 295 pounds) with quickness.
</P>
<P>
"People have been telling us how hard it's going to be moving the ball against
Auburn, and you can see that on the films," said Ohio State quarterback Greg
Frey, whose improved play was instrumental in the Buckeyes' turnaround from a
4-6-1 finish in 1988.
</P>
<P>
"You can't really tell until you get out there, though," Frey said. "I don't go
into a game worrying about whether we're going to run the ball or throw it. All
I want to do is win. We'll just do what we have to do."
</P>
<P>
The Buckeyes would prefer to run, allowing Carlos Snow and Scottie Graham to
pound away at the defense and control the clock. Snow rushed for 948 yards
despite a nagging knee problem and Graham gained 924 yards, but Frey has been
effective enough throwing that opponents can't take the passing game for
granted.
</P>
<P>
The junior quarterback led the Big Ten in passing efficiency and finished with
128 completions in 215 attempts for 1,900 yards and 12 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
There have been times this season when Ohio State's best defense has been its
offense. The Buckeyes gave up 386.7 yards and 24.2 points, but overcame it by
averaging 418.1 yards and 29.5 points on offense.
</P>
<P>
Ohio State's 28-18 loss to Michigan in the last game stopped a six-game winning
streak, but the Buckeyes weren't any hotter than Auburn down the stretch. The
Tigers looked average in building a 4-2 record but gained momentum in the weeks
leading up to a 30-20 victory over Alabama on Dec. 2.

ARIZONA'S OFFENSE SPUTTERS, BUT DEFENSE HELPS BEAT NORTH CAROLINA STATE

Scott Geyer's 85-yard interception return helped Arizona close out the decade
with a 17-10 victory over North Carolina State Sunday night in the inaugural
Copper Bowl, college football's newest postseason game.
</P>
<P>
Both teams dominated on defense and North Carolina State (7-5) held Arizona
(8-4) to only 50 rushing yards and just 130 total yards, the worst in both
categories for the Wildcats this season. The Wolfpack gained 222 yards passing
and 88 rushing and had the ball almost 16 minutes longer than Arizona.
</P>
<P>
But the Wildcat defense recovered two fumbles, made two interceptions and
survived three fourth-quarter drives by the Wolfpack that could have tied the
score.
</P>
<P>
A crowd of only 37,237 watched the game, about 20,000 under capacity at Arizona
Stadium, the Wildcats' home field.
</P>
<P>
Arizona led, 17-7, at halftime on a 37-yard pass from Ronald Veal to Olatide
Ogunfiditimi, Geyer's second interception of the game for the touchdown and
Gary Coston's 34-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
Shane Montgomery threw a four-yard pass to Todd Varn with 1:55 left in the half
for North Carolina State's only touchdown. The Wolfpack also scored on Damon
Hartman's 43-yard field-goal with 4:53 left in the third quarter, ending a
10-play, 62-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats forced turnovers that cut off three Wolfpack drives and came up
with the key plays when needed. Chris Singleton forced a punt with a 13-yard
sack and Ty Parten prevented Aubrey Shaw from converting a fourth-and-one at
the Arizona 26 with 3:03 to go.
</P>
<P>
After Arizona punted, the Wolfpack's last chance ended when Chris Williams
dropped a pass from Montgomery deep in Arizona territory with 57 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
Two plays after a Wolfpack punt, Veal passed to Ogunfiditimi to start the
scoring with 1:59 left in the first quarter. It was only the third touchdown
pass of the season for Veal.
</P>
<P>
Midway through the second period, with the Wolfpack at Arizona's 17 and driving
after Jesse Campbell intercepted a Veal pass at the Wildcat 29, Geyer stepped
in front of a pass by Montgomery intended for Varn and easily raced 85 yards to
make it 14-0.
</P>
<P>
Montgomery's short pass to Varn brought North Carolina State within a
touchdown, but Arizona drove from its 36 to the Wolfpack 24 after the ensuing
kickoff and Coston kicked his field goal 10 seconds before halftime.
</P>
<P>
Arizona's worst previous rushing total this season was 97 yards against Texas
Tech and the Wildcats had only 161 yards against Oregon. They lost both games.

Ed Chynoweth, the president of the Western Hockey League, stepped in and
persuaded members of the Tri-Cities Americans that they should play their
scheduled game against the Portland Winter Hawks at Portland Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The night before, the Americans and Winter Hawks were scheduled to play in in
Kennewick, Wash., but that game was canceled after 20 members of the Americans
refused to play.
</P>
<P>
The revolt was aimed at Bill LaForge, the team's new director of hockey
operations. The players want him fired.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the players said Saturday that they disliked LaForge's approach
and would not play until he is gone.
</P>
<P>
Chynoweth said a compromise was reached Sunday. He didn't say what it was, but
added: "What I pointed out to them, very simply, was that if they weren't
prepared to play, then I had no choice but to look at possible suspensions and
the possible loss of scholarships.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that's a threat. I think that's a fact of life."
</P>
<P>
LaForge, hired Dec. 17, has taken on the duties of co-coach with Rick Kozuback,
who has been head coach since the hockey season began. The Americans began the
season as a favorite to win the WHL's Western Division but have fallen into
third place at 16-16-3.

TWO BIG WINS GIVE JETS CONFIDENCE

The Winnipeg Jets enter the new year with a lot of confidence after victories
over two of their Smythe Division rivals.
</P>
<P>
Doug Smail scored the winning goal at 9:32 of the third period Sunday at
Winnipeg as the Jets followed an 2-1 overtime victory over the Calgary Flames
two nights earlier with a 3-2 win over the Edmonton Oilers.
</P>
<P>
"It was a big win for us in Calgary and it would have been a shame to come back
here and lose to another team that we're chasing," said defenseman Dave Ellett,
who scored in the second period. "It was a big confidence builder."
</P>
<P>
Dale Hawerchuk also scored for the Jets, who won their third straight to climb
to within three points of the third-place Kings.
</P>
<P>
Edmonton was outshot, 31-27, and showed the effects of having to play two games
in less than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The Oilers beat Montreal, 6-2, just 18 hours earlier in Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 5, New York Rangers 4 -- Mario Lemieux and Mark Recchi scored 20
seconds apart late in the third period at Madison Square Garden to extend the
Rangers' winless streak to 11 games.
</P>
<P>
Lemieux tied the game at 14:10 with a 10-foot wrist shot past Bob Froese.
Recchi tapped in Dan Quinn's pass at 14:30, extending the Rangers' winless
skein to 0-8-3, their longest since 1965.
</P>
<P>
The Penguins capitalized on a Ranger mistake for the tying goal. New York
failed to place a man in the penalty box when Kris King received a major for
slashing at 8:42. The Rangers were unable to get a stoppage of play after the
penalty expired and were still a skater short when Lemieux scored.
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 4, Buffalo 2 -- Pat LaFontaine scored three times, extending
his goal-scoring streak to seven games, to lead the Islanders at Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
LaFontaine, who took over the league lead with 33 goals, has 12 goals in his
last seven games, during which the Islanders are 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Detroit 6, New Jersey 4 -- Rick Zombo, Marc Habscheid and Lee Norwood had goals
during a 2:19 span as the Red Wings scored five times in the third period at
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
Detroit, which was 1-19-2 when trailing after two periods, scored four goals
within a 7 1/2-minute span early in the third period to overcome a pair of
two-goal deficits and snap a four-game winless streak.
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 2, St. Louis 1 -- Dave Gagner stole the puck from Rob Brind'Amour and
beat goaltender Vincent Riendeau 1:14 into overtime at Bloomington, Minn.
</P>
<P>
The North Stars, who were 2-11-2 in December, snapped winless streaks of six
games overall and five at home. Since it had the NHL's best record (15-8-1) on
Nov. 24, Minnesota is 3-12-2.
</P>
<P>
Brett Hull of the Blues sent the game into overtime with 8:21 left in
regulation with his 33rd goal.
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 2, Vancouver 2 -- The tie at Vancouver gave the Flyers sole
possession of first place in the Patrick Division, one point ahead of New
Jersey and Washington.

RULE CHANGE MAY HAVE OFFICIALS USING ERASER ON RECORD BOOK
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An obscure but potentially significant ruling has recently been enacted that
may change the face, and certainly the record books, of American road racing.
</P>
<P>
At the recent convention of The Athletics Congress, which governs track and
field and road racing, a rule was passed which makes times run in
point-to-point races ineligible for record consideration. The rule also
modified the allowance made for downhill portions of races.
</P>
<P>
Of course, times run on point-to-point courses would be considered "records,"
but only for that type of course, and would have little meaning. Times set on
courses falling outside the new guidelines will now be labeled "noteworthy
performances." Further, the rules will be applied retroactively to all existing
distance racing records.
</P>
<P>
Remember that last part. But first, a bit of background.
</P>
<P>
There are basically three kinds of course configurations for distance races:
</P>
<P>
Point-to-point -- Runners start at point A and finish at point B.
</P>
<P>
Loop -- Runners start at point A and go in a loop to finish back at point A.
</P>
<P>
Out-and-back -- Runners start at point A, go to a halfway point, and return on
the same course to finish back at point A.
</P>
<P>
There has long been discussion in the running community on which course is best
and most fair. Each has its merit, but the out-and-back course is considered
most fair. A point-to-point course may be designed so that runners may never
face a prevailing head wind, for example. A loop course may be designed to
skirt a horrible hill. On an out-and-back course the runner experiences the
best and worst of every factor. The tail wind on the first leg will be in his
face coming back. The downhill on which he could coast on the way out turns
into a grinding uphill on the way back.
</P>
<P>
Course variations have also made it difficult to compare relative times. All of
this has led to years of debate in the road racing community both domestically
and abroad, culminating in the passage of the TAC rule.
</P>
<P>
So what? So, consider that America's biggest marathons, Boston, New York and
Chicago, are all point-to-point races. Also consider that Alberto Salazar's
American marathon record for men was set at Boston. Joan Benoit Samuelson's
record for women was set at Chicago (which may sneak in because of an rule
change that liberalized the allowable distance from the start to the finish
line). Also consider that Mark Nenow's 10K American record at Crescent City
fails the start/finish test.
</P>
<P>
And, while the rule does not apply to world records, the international impact
is the same. Especially since Americans do compete internationally. The women's
world record was set at London, a point-to-point course. The Seoul Olympic
Marathon was point-to-point. The course for the 1994 Barcelona Olympic marathon
is point-to-point and with elevation variations that may not make it eligible
for record consideration.
</P>
<P>
The impact this rule will have on American marathons is tremendous. According
to records compiled by the Road Race Management newsletter, under this new rule
the top 17 all-time performances for U.S. men are ineligible for record
consideration. That appears to make the American record-holder at the marathon
Tony Sandoval, with a 2:10:20 set Sept. 9, 1979.
</P>
<P>
The idea of changing start/finish lines after decades of tradition may have
race directors in a snit. The Boston Marathon is actually the Hopkinton, Mass.,
to Boston Marathon. The New York City Marathon's entire cachet is the fact that
the race starts on Staten Island and weaves through all five boroughs.
Tradition and logistics are not the only issues. Television loves the New
England-in-spring look of the early stages of the Boston race and the ethnic
neighborhoods of the New York course.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the start/finish problem, Boston also fails the elevation
requirement. Despite its well-known landmark, Heartbreak Hill, Boston is
basically a downhill race. The new rule allows for an elevation decrease of 10
feet per mile. Boston has a net decrease of 14 feet per mile. In fact,
according to Basil Honikman of TAC, Boston's dramatic drop in elevation has the
effect of making it 500 yards short.
</P>
<P>
This may account for the fact that, up to the end of 1988, six of the 10
fastest times ever run by an American were at Boston.
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Marathon is well within the tolerance levels of the new rule.
L.A. is and always has been a loop course. It is and shall remain a flat
course. The elevation change for the race is one foot per mile, barely
noticeable. The total change is 187 feet, as compared to Boston's drop of some
450 feet.
</P>
<P>
This rule change may serve to boost L.A.'s attraction to elite American
runners, who may not want to waste a world-class effort on a course in which
they can't get a record.
</P>
<P>
Certainly the rule will have a profound effect on the sport. However, not all
change is bad. Times on the roads have long been properly called world bests,
not world records, and for a reason. Unlike races on tracks, road race course
have had little uniformity or even a modest adherence to worldwide standards.
Only by factoring in such elements as elevation, wind and even the layout of a
course can uniform standards begin to be applied to the sport.
</P>
<P>
This difficult decision by TAC is merely the wave of the future and can only
help lead to the eventual ratification of road race "records" as accepted world
records. While internationally some racing officials are dragging their feet on
adopting TAC's rule in their own federations, look for this idea to slowly gain
worldwide acceptance.
</P>
<P>
Former marathoner Dick Beardsley, whose 2:08:54 is second all-time among U.S.
men, is struggling to recover from an injury that mangled his leg and left him
with a goal of walking again, much less running.
</P>
<P>
Beardsley, who lives in rural Minnesota, suffered the injury in a farm accident
Nov. 13. He was transferring corn to a crib on his farm near Shafer when his
coveralls became caught in a tractor power takeoff, a drive shaft used to power
farm implements. He suffered a broken right wrist, broken ribs, cuts on his
calf muscles in his left leg and severe ligament damage to the left knee before
he was able to turn off the machine.
</P>
<P>
Although the accident was horrible, Beardsley had been working with a physical
therapist three times a week at his farm and his recuperation from the surgery
had been progressing well.
</P>
<P>
Then disaster struck again. Last month Beardsley, 33, developed a severe
postoperative infection in the site of the original surgery and was admitted to
a hospital after developing a fever. Beardsley's agent, Bill Wenmark, said the
infection had not invaded the knee joint or gotten into Beardsley's blood
system, which was good news.
</P>
<P>
The road ahead is long, however. The second surgery sets his rehabilitation
back several months. It may take Beardsley years to get out from under the
medical bills. He had no health insurance at the time of the accident.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Running Notes
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Marathon has added a 5K race, to start a half hour after the
marathon runners. Like the marathoners, the 5K runners will finish in the
Coliseum. The March 4 race will get substantially more television coverage than
last year. KCOP Channel 13 has increased its total coverage to 8 1/2 hours,
with a half-hour preview show the night before the race, five hours of race
coverage and a three-hour highlight show. Last year's coverage was a total of 5
1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach Marathon's annual series of clinics begins Jan. 9. Race director
Joe Carlson will outline the program for the weeks leading up to the race. The
clinics are conducted in cooperation with the Long Beach Parks and Recreation
Department and will be held at Recreation Park Community Center at 7:30 p.m.
Information: (213) 494-2664. . . . The Redondo Beach Super Bowl Sunday 10K is
going strong in its 12th year. The Jan. 28 race usually draws a large field,
this year about 15,000 runners are expected. In addition to the 10K race, there
is a companion 5K walk, which is in its second year.

<P>
People are lined up on the freeway, trying to get to work from San Diego's most
popular new suburb -- Mexico.
</P>
<P>
It's 7:15 a.m. In 45 minutes, you and thousands of others will have beaten the
morning rush -- you hope -- only to sit at your desk for eight hours before
returning to the San Diego/Tijuana/drive-time fray.
</P>
<P>
The scenario is more likely than you might imagine.
</P>
<P>
Thousands may work in "America's Finest City" but they won't be able to live
here. Those who cannot afford California may look in desperation to Baja
California, or points many miles east of here.
</P>
<P>
Welcome to San Diego in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The place where the population will continue to boom; where the Hispanic and
Asian communities will gain increasing prominence; where the work force will
undergo sweeping changes. It's the place with more traffic, more smog, and a
vexing need to resolve such problems as what to do with the airport and how to
build more jails.
</P>
<P>
With a population expected to reach nearly 2.8 million in the year 2000,
growing 16% from today's 2.4 million, San Diego County will continue its
urbanization curve through the 1990s, demographers predict.
</P>
<P>
Even more stunning growth is expected in the San Diego Unified School District.
From 1986 to the turn of the century, the number of students is expected to
increase 46% to 165,000. The largest increase is expected to be in the
high-school population.
</P>
<P>
But planners say those increasing numbers of people will be increasingly
squeezed for places to live -- leading to higher prices, vanishing open space
and the emergence of new suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Max Schetter, director for the Economic Research Bureau of the Greater San
Diego Chamber of Commerce, said the county growth will produce surprising
shifts and turns, not the least of which is the "Tijuana factor," in which not
only do Mexicans continue to migrate to the United States to find jobs, but
U.S. residents move in the other direction, with affordable housing in mind.
</P>
<P>
The poor and lower-middle class might settle in Mexico only because the average
price of a San Diego home may be prohibitive by the year 2000, outstripping
gains in income.
</P>
<P>
The average household income is expected to rise 90% during the decade, to
$92,400. But the average home price is expected to rise by 124%, to $439,500.
</P>
<P>
"The huge numbers of Hispanics and Asians coming into the county will work in
San Diego but may live in Mexico," Schetter said. "As housing becomes less
affordable, they'll have to consider Tijuana, or points considerably east of
here.
</P>
<P>
"People will want to work here but can't afford to live here. It could affect
all ethnic groups of the lower middle class (including non-Hispanic whites)."
</P>
<P>
As workers line up at the border, creating massive traffic jams in an effort to
get to work, Schetter predicts, the county will need new border crossings.
</P>
<P>
Schetter and other experts say that,
</P>
<P>
except for the upper class, those who wish to move within the county -- "to
trade up" -- will be severely limited in doing so.
</P>
<P>
Residents will have massive equity in their homes, but it won't do them much
good unless they move to another region, because all the other houses in San
Diego County will have gone up just as much.
</P>
<P>
In response to the demand for housing, during the 14 years from 1986 to 2000,
the number of housing units is expected to increase by 37%, to more than 1
million. Vacant land is expected to undergo a corresponding shrinkage of
100,000 acres, a loss of about 10%.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Makeup
</P>
<P>
Given the press that the increasing Hispanic population has received, it is not
surprising to most San Diegans that continuing migration and high birth rates
will mean that the number of Hispanics in the county will more than double, to
700,000, from 1980 to the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
But what confounds even some demographers is that the Asian population will
more than triple during that time, to 356,600. The change was not foreseen
until recently.
</P>
<P>
But Richard Madsen, a sociologist at UC San Diego and contributor to the book,
"Habits of the Heart: Individualism and Commitment in American Life," said the
Asian explosion makes perfect sense when considering its sources: Hong Kong,
Indochina and other cities in California.
</P>
<P>
Control of Hong Kong reverts from the British to the Chinese in 1997, so Madsen
believes refugees will leave Hong Kong -- San Diego being only one destination
-- over a gradual 7-year period. He believes the evacuation of Indochinese from
Cambodia and Vietnam has by no means ceased. He sees greater numbers of
Japanese and Koreans arriving in San Diego because of its promise of
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
"You have as many as 50,000 people a year leaving Hong Kong now," he said.
"Plus, the Hong Kong government recently turned away thousands of Indochinese
refugees. They had to return to Vietnam. Sooner or later, some of those will
come here."
</P>
<P>
Madsen sees the West Coast as becoming "much more multiethnic in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
"Every generation has had its share of immigrants, but clearly the most visible
immigrants in this generation will be Asians and Hispanics. It presents certain
challenges.
</P>
<P>
"America has long been dominated by European values. The mentality has been
WASPish or European, and that may change. Americans have tended to be more open
than some societies, but on the other hand, this nasty streak of racism seems
to be coming back. I thought racism had waned after the civil rights movement,
but that isn't the case at all."
</P>
<P>
The non-Hispanic white population -- in 1988, 67% of the county's residents --
is expected to fall to 58.5% by the year 2000. The county's black population is
expected to stay about the same, at nearly 6%.
</P>
<P>
Neither the San Diego Police Department nor the San Diego County Sheriff's
Department keep statistics on so-called hate crimes, except to say that they
rose significantly in the 1980s. Madsen fears the county's clash of cultures
may ignite more in the future.
</P>
<P>
He noted, for instance, that the number of Asians entering the state's elite
University of California system increased dramatically during the 1980s, with
the trend expected to flex itself more strongly during the next decade. As
minorities win out in academic and professional challenges, "it's not hard to
see," he said, why tensions will be inflamed.
</P>
<P>
Age
</P>
<P>
The aging baby boomers will play a major role in making San Diego an older
county in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the median age was 28.8 years; by the year 2000, it is projected to be
35.8 -- just about middle age.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Tayman, senior planner with the San Diego Assn. of Governments (SANDAG),
said that change will affect the make-up of families, putting older parents at
home with their children. "The baby boomers are having kids a lot later," he
said. "We'll have a lot more parents, 50 and 60 years old, with kids home. It's
kind of terrifying when you think about it. We expect to see a tremendous
increase in high school students in the Nineties."
</P>
<P>
Madsen, the sociologist, said older parents may be a change for the better.
</P>
<P>
"Such parents will probably be more mature, more comfortable materially and
thus better able to take care of children," he said. "I see it as a plus. They
may feel more sympathetic to paying for education, as much as they do, say, for
health care."
</P>
<P>
But those older parents are expected to face double burdens -- caring for their
own parents at the same time that they care for their children.
</P>
<P>
As life expectancy increases, the number of double-generation elderly is
expected to increase -- "younger" senior citizens in their 60s, for example,
caring for parents who are in their 80s.
</P>
<P>
"We'll see a significant increase in the elderly," Tayman said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Employment
</P>
<P>
Tayman predicts dramatic changes in the county's work force. He said that more
than half the new workers will be female, and more than 60% of new workers will
be minorities. He said that only 15% of new workers will be white, non-Hispanic
males.
</P>
<P>
Because of the increasing entry of women into the workplace, he foresees child
care becoming perhaps the most major employment issue of the 1990s. In
addition, the new ethnic makeup will make affirmative action a major issue of
the new decade, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to see a lot of discrimination suits."
</P>
<P>
Those workers are expected to go to jobs increasingly centered in the high-tech
arena and focused more and more away from the military.
</P>
<P>
Recent studies of employment trends predict the number of direct military jobs
staying the same in the county through the year 2000. But Schetter said those
figures might have been outdated by a combination of glasnost and the federal
deficit.
</P>
<P>
"It's a trend that's been growing for a long time," he said. "At the end of
World War II, 70% of all county jobs were oriented to the military. Now, the
figure is somewhere near 20%."
</P>
<P>
Even if the number of military workers remains the same, it will be dwarfed by
expected increases in other fields. For example, the number of retail service
employees will increase from 1986 to the turn of the century from 141,069 to
203,307. Manufacturing, which employed 127,893 people in 1986, is expected to
provide jobs for 200,000 by the end of the new decade.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the county's work force is expected to increase during that time by
50% and almost 500,000 jobs -- none of those in the armed services.
</P>
<P>
And very little of that increase -- 139, to be exact -- is expected to fall in
the agricultural category, a sign of increasing urbanization in the county.
</P>
<P>
Schetter said the county is becoming more high-tech, more white-collar, more
business-oriented and much less dependent on the military.
</P>
<P>
No sleepy little Navy town any more; no rural backwater in the shadow of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transportation
</P>
<P>
The dramatic increase in the number of workers also puts pressure on the county
to find a way of getting those people to work.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the growth of the work force, the increase in traffic will be much
greater than the growth of the population," Tayman said.
</P>
<P>
Tayman said San Diego's "drive-alone" compulsion has to cease, or the rush-hour
commute will be "horrendous," on the order, say, of Houston or Los Angeles. He
said the current average of 1.1 San Diegans commuting to work each day by car
must increase to 1.5 or 1.7 by the end of the decade to avoid disastrous
traffic snarls. As a result, Tayman said car-pooling may evolve from the realm
of "polite suggestion" to a legislative mandate born of necessity.
</P>
<P>
Bill Tuomi, SANDAG's transportation expert, said San Diego County has 56% more
traffic today than it did nine years ago. He said new freeways, extensions of
old ones, an expanded trolley line and a commuter rail system through North
County will ease the traffic burden, but the key is boosting the passenger load
per car.
</P>
<P>
Tuomi said that 55 million people ride the county's trolley or bus lines each
year; the number "needs to reach" 95 million by 1995. In the 1990s, the
trolley's eastern end, now in El Cajon, will stretch as far as Santee. It will
move north, from downtown to Old Town and will soon service the new Convention
Center as well.
</P>
<P>
Tuomi said the No. 1 traffic hot spot of the 1990s is Interstate 5,
specifically the junction of Interstates 5 and 805.
</P>
<P>
"Interstate 5 carries more than 200,000 cars a day now," Tuomi said. "In 1980,
the number was 100,000, so it's doubled in a decade. We're expecting 310,000
cars a day on I-5 by the year 2000. That's definitely a source of concern.
</P>
<P>
"Interstate 8 is our most heavily traveled freeway, handling about 270,000 cars
a day. We expect to hold at that number until the year 2000. The traffic growth
of East County is no longer as fast or fierce as up north. We expect the
extension of California 52, which now goes from I-5 to Tierrasanta, to be
extended to Santee and to ease the west-east burden dramatically."
</P>
<P>
The other major transportation conflict of the 1990s will be the airport.
</P>
<P>
Jack Koerper, SANDAG's special projects director, said the question of what to
do with Lindbergh Field will be resolved in the Nineties, one way or the other.
If it isn't, if procrastination rules, then that in itself will be a decision,
Koerper said: "Some people don't act until there's a crisis, so maybe we'll
have one."
</P>
<P>
The Navy objects to making Miramar Naval Air Station the site of a new regional
air facility, although the air station comes up repeatedly among the panels
charged with making a decision on a new location. The Navy says the air station
is not now and never will be available to civilian use.
</P>
<P>
Koerper sees potential crises as an air crash in the downtown area, traffic so
ugly on Harbor Drive that "you'll have to arrive two hours early to catch your
flight."
</P>
<P>
"Or we might have our air-carrier service curtailed because of use restrictions
on the runway," he said. "Lindbergh might be taxed with one big convention
after another coming in to use the Convention Center. We'll find we don't have
the airport to accommodate the Convention Center, and then we'll do something."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Prognosis
</P>
<P>
Tayman and others say San Diego "will be more big-city in the years to come,"
taking on the good, and the bad, that come with high-level urban living.
</P>
<P>
We may see a downtown sports arena, and a professional basketball or hockey
team to play in it; we should see at least one more Super Bowl (probably in
'93); at least one baseball All-Star Game (for sure in '92) and maybe another
World Series.
</P>
<P>
Tayman and others think planning is sophisticated enough here to prevent San
Diego from becoming a crude clone of its northern neighbor, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
"Ironically," said Schetter of the Chamber of Commerce, "our organization was
formed in 1870, and the issues they were talking about then -- housing,
transportation, water, commerce, jobs, crimes . . . are the same ones we're
talking about now. We seem to have done pretty well between then and now. I see
no reason why we can't move forward with hope."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On a Growth Curve: PROFILE OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY
</P>
<P>
An older and higher-income population of San Diegans will crowd into more
expensive houses in the year 2000, planners predict. The county expect to add
about 400,000 new residents in the 1990s. While much public attention has been
given to the projected rise in Hispanic population, it is the Asian population
that will have the largest relative growth.

VALLEY CENTER'S HOMELESS PUT BLAME ON BUILDING BAN
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Madge May put most of her savings into a nice piece of property in Valley
Center and planned to build a little house for herself and her 6-year-old
daughter in the pretty little town.
</P>
<P>
Two years later, she still waits for a chance to build her dream home, unable
to obtain a building permit because of a 9-year-old building moratorium in the
valley and unable to sell the land to anyone else. She and her daughter have
been living in a white frame garage on the property, "roughing it" without
proper toilets or electricity and hoping that inspectors look the other way.
</P>
<P>
Her washer and dryer sit unused and unplugged in a corner while she goes to the
coin laundry each week.
</P>
<P>
"I knew there was a building moratorium, but I thought the sewer was going in,"
May said about buying the 3-acre parcel. "My friend (Bob Winsett) sold it to me
for a modest price. He had bought it in 1978, and the taxes were eating him
up."
</P>
<P>
May had good reason to believe that Valley Center was going to get a sewer
system when she bought her land. The Valley Center Municipal Water District had
been working on sewer plans for the central part of the valley since 1975. The
county Board of Supervisors in 1980 imposed a building moratorium because the
valley's septic systems posed a health hazard. The moratorium brought a federal
grant for the $13-million sewer project -- and construction of the sewer
project would have meant the end of the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
But, over the years, the population around the valley had changed from farmers,
dairymen and ranchers to retirees, young families and others seeking to escape
from the urban hubbub.
</P>
<P>
Newcomers to the valley northeast of Escondido moved there for much the same
reasons that Madge May did: to get away from noise and traffic and smog. The
thought of a "country town" with tract housing and traffic signals and shopping
malls that a sewer system would allow welded the valley's residents into an
slow-growth, anti-sewer coalition.
</P>
<P>
Soon after May bought her property, the slow-growth coalition campaigned for
and won the right to have a deciding vote on any project by the local water
district costing more than $1 million. The sewer project was dead and the
federal grant withdrawn. Only the decade-old moratorium remained.
</P>
<P>
Although she has plenty of space for a septic system, May cannot put one in
because of the moratorium, which was placed on 3,200 acres of the central
valley area after the rainy years of 1978 and 1979. During the late 1970s and
early '80s, ground-water levels in the valley rose nearly to the surface and
septic systems contaminated the runoff. Eleven septic systems failed.
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, Madge May has attempted to "talk sense" to county
officials and win an exemption from the building moratorium. After all, the
rainy years are long past and the ground water has receded so low that it would
take a 40-day deluge to bring them back up to contamination levels, she argues.
</P>
<P>
The moratorium was "a political move" to give the local water district the
"emergency situation" it needed to win a federal grant for a sewer system, she
said. Now, in the driest year in the past century, why can't the county Board
of Supervisors allow one financially strapped woman to build one small septic
system?
</P>
<P>
Runoff from May's septic system would raise the Valley Center ground-water
level by only 0.4 of an inch in 1,000 years, engineers tell her.
</P>
<P>
"And the irony of it is that I could plant my 3 acres in citrus and put
3-million gallons of irrigation water into the ground every year and do it
legally," May said. "It just doesn't make sense. But, no matter what you say,
no matter how rational you are, they just won't listen."
</P>
<P>
May is not alone. A lot of property owners are in the same fix -- unable to do
a thing with their property.
</P>
<P>
Ben Benson owned industrially zoned property in the moratorium area and
complains that "the only thing I could do was pay taxes on it and graze horses
on it."
</P>
<P>
Fred Lloyd, a Valley Center businessman, said merchants in town "are being held
hostage by the moratorium." How can the town grow and businesses thrive when a
person can't even add a bedroom, he asks.
</P>
<P>
Jack Sharp has owned property in the moratorium area for more than a dozen
years and planned to build his retirement home there. He isn't getting any
younger, he says.
</P>
<P>
Val Wynn, a civil engineer with offices in Valley Center, pointed out that the
moratorium has forced development out of the logical "town center" onto the
edge of town. The school district had to build its new schools out on the
fringe of Valley Center.
</P>
<P>
What is happening, businessmen and town folk agree, is that Valley Center is
growing around the edges, leaving the moratorium area bare, like a hole in the
middle of a doughnut.
</P>
<P>
Janet Waltz, assistant chief of county environmental health services,
sympathizes with people caught in moratorium, especially with Madge May.
</P>
<P>
"I admire her greatly," Waltz said of May. "She has tremendous perseverance."
</P>
<P>
But Waltz takes issue with those who say the building ban is no longer needed
in these dry years. Despite the lack of rainfall for the past three winters,
Waltz said, there are still septic tank failures in Valley Center and the
ground-water level has not retreated all that much.
</P>
<P>
County supervisors echoed her opinion earlier this month when they refused to
lift the Valley Center building moratorium. Perhaps because of the plight of
May and the dozens of other property owners caught in the building ban,
slow-growth forces and building advocates are slowly edging toward a
compromise: sewers in a rural community.
</P>
<P>
Marty Tisdale, chairman of the Valley Center Planning Group, reports that "the
key players in extremely diverse factions" are coming together to revise the
community plan, lowering the high-density zoning that was imposed in
anticipation of a sewer system.
</P>
<P>
Ken Knust, who represents the pro-sewer forces, says "both sides do not agree
wholeheartedly on anything," but acknowledges that "they are talking for the
very first time."
</P>
<P>
Madge May is in the center of the peace negotiations, coming home from work for
a quick meal with her daughter in their rustic shed, then rushing off to a
subcommittee meeting, which often lasts well into the night.
</P>
<P>
She resents the time it is taking and admits that daughter Amy views the latest
shift in the growth vs. no-growth battle as "just another thing that takes me
away from home for three or four hours at a time."
</P>
<P>
May doesn't know if the compromise talks will earn her the right to build her
house, and she's getting mighty tired of the fight and the pioneer existence
she and her daughter are forced to live.
</P>
<P>
"But then I think, what else can I do?" she said.

<P>
Some things they said during the 1980s:
</P>
<P>
Claude Gilbert, answering a booster's criticism about the red-and-white
uniforms worn by San Diego State's football team in 1980: "I designed those
uniforms. I've been catching hell here for eight years, and I'll keep catching
hell. But you know something? I don't care. We're going to keep those uniforms
until you get yourselves a new football coach."
</P>
<P>
The red-and-white uniforms were gone in 1981. So was Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
Don Coryell, on the SDSU administration's firing of Gilbert: "They've got their
heads so far underground they can't see."
</P>
<P>
Not all of Donald Sterling's promises were hollow.
</P>
<P>
Take this one from 1981: "One day, it will be harder to get a Clipper ticket
than it will be to get a Charger ticket."
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, anyway.
</P>
<P>
An irate Rich Gossage struck out at Padre owner Joan Kroc in the aftermath of
the clubhouse beer ban in 1986: "She's poisoning the world with her
hamburgers."
</P>
<P>
Steve Garvey, on the reaction of his new wife, Candace, to his revelation that
he might have fathered two babies out of wedlock: " . . . Her greatest line to
me was, 'Well, at least I got you off the streets.' "
</P>
<P>
Jim McMahon, commenting on Brigham Young University before the 1981 Holiday
Bowl: "I don't have a lot of fond memories of school. In fact, I hate school.
Once I graduate and get to the NFL, I won't be coming back here."
</P>
<P>
Jim McMahon, responding to a reporter's questions in 1989 by blowing his nose
at him: "There's an answer for you."
</P>
<P>
Dan Fouts could be surly in postgame interview situations, particularly after a
game such as the 34-27 loss to Oakland in the 1981 American Football Conference
championship game. A microphone thrust through a crowd of reporters veritably
brushed his beard.
</P>
<P>
"Get this damn thing out of my mouth," he snarled.
</P>
<P>
He looked up. The offending reporter was his father, Bob, a broadcaster in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
Charger defensive back Pete Shaw, lamenting the 1981 trade that sent wide
receiver John Jefferson to the Green Bay Packers after a long contract
squabble: "A lot of players are angry about this. We feel a deep loss, like a
death."
</P>
<P>
Michael Fay, the owner of New Zealand, complaining that Dennis Conner and his
catamaran, Stars &amp; Stripes, had "dogged it" in winning the 1988 America's
Cup races off Point Loma: "I don't think that other boat was raced at all out
there today. It was disappointing to see a competitor ahead of us parked . . .
We would rather have been beaten by a greater margin than see a competitor sail
like that."
</P>
<P>
Former San Diego State basketball Coach David Gaines: "You know what you call a
guy who finishes last in a class of 25 at medical school? You call him doctor.
You know what you call a coach who finishes last? You call him fired."
</P>
<P>
Gaines was fired after SDSU tied for last in 1987.
</P>
<P>
A classified advertisement from 1980, when Ozzie Smith and his representative
were trying to squeeze a better contract out of the Padres: "Padres baseball
player wants part-time employment to supplement income. College education.
Willing to work. Prefer PR-type employment. Needs hours tailored to baseball
schedule but would quit baseball for right opportunity."
</P>
<P>
Joan Kroc offered him a job as a gardener.
</P>
<P>
He is doing quite well these days with the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
Dave Winfield, after leaving the Padres and signing a 10-year contract worth
$15 million with the New York Yankees following the 1980 season: "Hey, I'm
ready, I paid my dues, I need some attention. I feel good about my supporting
cast."
</P>
<P>
The "supporting cast" won 103 games in 1980 without him.

FOOTNOTES: QUAKE PUT DAMPER ON WORK
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For all their pluck, Bay Area workers did not accomplish much in the weeks
after October's massive earthquake.
</P>
<P>
Companies surveyed by William M. Mercer Meidinger Hansen, a benefits consulting
firm, reported that employees were afraid to commute to their jobs and use
office elevators, easily flew off the handle, had trouble concentrating on work
and were falling asleep in meetings. "Very little work got done," most
employers agreed.
</P>
<P>
And that just covered the workers who showed up. "At least one employee took
early retirement on the spot, rather than return to work," according to the
Mercer study of 39 companies employing 120,000 Bay Area residents.
</P>
<P>
While a majority of employers reported signs of emotional distress among their
workers in the three weeks after the Oct. 17 quake, fewer than half had taken
steps to improve workplace safety, upgrade disaster plans or provide employees
information about earthquake preparedness, the study found. One company brought
in a geologist to talk to workers; three arranged direct help for employees hit
hard by quake damage. Only two firms did nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planning to Move? Try Malta
</P>
<P>
The weather may have been rotten, but the tiny Mediterranean island of Malta
still hopes to capitalize on the worldwide publicity it received during the
recent Bush-Gorbachev summit there. And California is the chief target.
</P>
<P>
"People before were asking, 'Where is Malta?' " said Joseph Vella Bonnici,
manager of investment promotion for the government's Malta Development Corp.
"At least now they know where it is."
</P>
<P>
To lure foreign investors, Malta offers a package of incentives similar to
those provided by some other European countries, including such goodies as a
10-year tax holiday and reduced tax rates for foreign managers.
</P>
<P>
The government is most interested in attracting electronics firms, which could
use Malta as a jumping-off point to market in Europe. So Bonnici said the
development agency plans to open a promotion office in California sometime next
year. By then, the image of President Bush trapped aboard a Navy ship for 10
hours by high seas may be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Microwave, Mexican Style
</P>
<P>
When it comes to microwaveable snack food, Mexican-style food is much more
popular than ready-to-eat frozen hamburgers or packaged croissant sandwiches --
especially in California. A recent study by the Los Angeles office of Selling
Areas Marketing Inc. finds that Americans spend 60 cents per capita on frozen
burritos and only 30 cents per capita on frozen hamburgers. However,
Californians spend two to three times the national average on frozen Mexican
food products.
</P>
<P>
Those reports did not go unnoticed at Four 'n Twenty, the Tustin-based
subsidiary of an Australian company. It began to distribute a two-ounce,
beef-filled pastry called "Aussie Snacks" in April and plans to add a
taco-flavored pastry to its line. The product will be introduced in Los Angeles
and San Francisco early this year, said Craig Lesly, general manager.

OCEANSIDE DRUGS, VIOLENCE BLAMED ON GANG INVASION
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oceanside police say drug use and violence among the city's long-established
ethnic gangs have been overshadowed by the arrival of Crips gang members from
Los Angeles and elsewhere looking to set up a permanent cocaine trade.
</P>
<P>
"We're working three or four shootings by these new gangsters in town," said
Ruben Sandoval, a seven-year veteran of the police department's gang unit,
which was increased from two to four officers to handle the Crips.
</P>
<P>
According to Oceanside police reports, four incidents within a 10-day period in
October reflected the violence that they believe has been brought by the
newcomers:
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 21, a woman was shot in the leg when she tried to stop gang members
from using her apartment to sell drugs. She told investigating officers "that
L.A. Crips gang members had been using her apartment to sell cocaine."
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 23, two women allege they were fired at by Crips after one of the
women told a gang member her little brother would no longer sell drugs for
them. A victim said in the police report that "L.A. Crips had recently moved
into the Oceanside area and had taken up selling rock cocaine" from an
apartment.
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 28, a woman told police that four Los Angeles Crips forced their way
into her apartment after beating up a man outside in a drug dispute. She said
gang members had been trying to use her apartment as a base for drug sales.
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 31, two local men were shot and wounded by two suspects. A police
report said one victim recounted that his assailant had claimed to be a member
of a Los Angeles gang. The shooting occurred when one of the men warned the
gang members to stop selling cocaine from his sister's apartment.
</P>
<P>
Such bloodshed has become commonplace in metropolitan areas like Los Angeles
and San Diego. But drug-related violence by outsiders is new to the 130,000
people of Oceanside, where gang fighting was largely confined to Hispanic and
Samoan gangs arguing over their turf.
</P>
<P>
Police say that about 15 to 20 Los Angeles-based Crips first came to Oceanside
in the summer of 1988, selling cocaine from hotels and motels on the weekends,
and returning to Los Angeles during the week.
</P>
<P>
They dealt drugs for six months until some were arrested; beefed up police
patrols pressed most of the others to leave, evidenced by a sharp decline in
cocaine sales, say police. "We were saturating the streets with 50 to 70
officers," said Oceanside police Chief Lee Drummond.
</P>
<P>
A few months of peace followed, but last summer a new batch of Crips arrived.
</P>
<P>
"There were more of them," said Sandoval, about 35 or 40, he estimated. Most
came from Los Angeles, but police learned from driver's licenses and vehicle
registration that others came from San Bernardino, Lancaster and Perris.
</P>
<P>
"The difference is, they're going into certain residential areas and buying off
the homeowners by giving them drugs or paying them," Sandoval said. The Crips
live here, but resupply themselves with drugs from Los Angeles, he said.
</P>
<P>
An alarmed Drummond initiated a $20,000 study of the city's gang problem by law
enforcement consultants, including Manuel Ortega, police chief in Bell-Cudahy,
and Lt. Paul Jefferson of the Los Angeles Police Department.
</P>
<P>
The study, released last month, concluded that "gang-related crime in
Oceanside, while still largely confined to traditional turf wars, (has)
recently taken on a distinctly more dangerous and criminal nature" because of
the arrival of "predatory gangs."
</P>
<P>
Oceanside police believe their city has attracted the Crips because it is
located between Los Angeles and San Diego and it represents a new market for
rock and crack cocaine. "If gone unchecked, they could set up a lucrative
market here," Drummond said.
</P>
<P>
A 20-year-old Oceanside woman, who used to sell crack bought from Los Angeles
Crips living in Oceanside, said there's opportunity here.
</P>
<P>
"The ones who come down here are small frys up there, but down here they're
really big," said Leilani, who spoke on the condition that her street name and
last name not be used. She said a quantity of cocaine that sells for $5 in Los
Angeles gets $20 in Oceanside.
</P>
<P>
She said Crips enlist "rushers" who stand outside a crack house to make quick
transactions with buyers who drive or walk buy, and also hire drug users to
deal cocaine for them downtown.
</P>
<P>
"If their dope is good, each of five rushers can make $1,000 or more a day,"
Leilani said. Crips "like to have 13- and 14-year-olds selling for them because
when they get into trouble, they're just going to juvenile hall, but they're
not going to do no big time."
</P>
<P>
Sandoval said police have arrested more than 100 users and dealers over the
last three months and 10 search warrants have been issued to enter suspected
drug houses. Scores of arrests have been made around the 200 block of North
Hill Street, where Rick Trevino, Sandoval's partner for three years, said
people working for the Crips were doing a brisk and highly visible business.
"They were blatantly dealing," said Trevino.
</P>
<P>
But downtown, cocaine street sales appear to have fallen over the last few
weeks, and Sandoval believes the lull may be caused by the cold nights or the
increased police enforcement.

rise in violence and drug sales on an influx of members of the Crips gang from
Los Angeles and other areas. Police say gang members do a brisk business,

Jack McKeon, Padres: McKeon, hired as vice president/baseball operations in
September 1980, turned the Padres' franchise from a laughingstock into a prized
possession. And as the citizens of San Diego have learned, it's not wise to
become emotionally attached to any player. McKeon has engineered trades
involving 165 players since his arrival. Their 1990 spring-training roster
consists of just four players -- Tony Gwynn, Eric Show, Garry Templeton and Ed
Whitson -- who opened the 1987 season with them. They don't call him Trader
Jack for nothing.

Tony Gwynn, Padres: It took just one minor league season for the Padres to be
convinced that they had something special on their hands. Of course, when
you've got a guy batting .331 in rookie league and .462 in double-A, it doesn't
take a genius to figure he might have some major league talent. What
materialized was four National League batting championships, five All-Star
appearances and an image that would put Wally Cleaver to shame. Gwynn is the
pride and joy of the Padres, and one day just might be standing behind a podium
at Cooperstown, being inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Newby-Fraser has become a household name on the triathlon circuit. She has won
three Ironman Triathlons and more than 40 other championships, including the
two in San Diego this year, the Bud Light and San Diego International. For
winning all of these titles, she has won more than $100,000. A native of
Zimbabwe, South Africa, Newby-Fraser started her racing career in Europe in
1985. She finished third in the Ironman Triathlon that year -- and then got

Ron Newman, Sockers: He has had plenty of critics, including players who don't
always see eye-to-eye with his sometimes unorthodox methods. But the Sockers
have won seven championships this decade under him. Newman has always had a
knack for molding players from all over the world, with vastly different
backgrounds, into a unit that wins. They fight, but they win. Newman has also
established himself as an innovator, coming up with new strategies each season
to keep a step ahead of other coaches -- and even the referees.

The Sockers: Who else? Seven championships. Each year, they have to think up a
new slogan. We've seen: "Twice is not Enough." "Keep the Streak Alive." "One
for the Thumb." "The Joy of Six." "Seven is Heaven." Every few years, new
players come in to boost them to a new title. Mainstays of the first group were
Juli Veee, Jean Willrich and Kaz Deyna. Brian Quinn and Kevin Crow came along
in 1983, Branko Segota and Steve Zungul in 1984. And goalies Zoltan Toth and
Victor Nogueira have anchored championships the past two seasons. The biggest
threat to the Sockers' dominance in the '80s wasn't any one particular team but
the Major Indoor Soccer League, which nearly folded several times because of
financial difficulties.

1984 Padres: The improbable Padres, never before taken seriously, rode their
second winning season all the way to their first World Series. They captured
the hearts of the city like no other sports team, and maybe that's what helped
them reach the Series. Nobody wanted the fun to end. They finished the regular
season 92-70 but opened the National League playoffs in Chicago by dropping two
consecutive games. Facing a sweep, the Padres returned to San Diego after Game
2 to find a few thousand fans waiting in the San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium
parking lot. Recharged, the Padres became the first team in NL Championship
Series play, and the second team in Championship Series history, to overcome an
0-2 deficit and win a series. The fun finally ended, though, when the Padres
were defeated by Detroit in the World Series, four games to one.

1981-82 NFL playoffs, Chargers vs. Dolphins: On the day after New Year's, 1982,
Rolf Benirschke's 27-yard field goal at 13:52 of overtime finished a dramatic,
41-38, Charger victory in the Orange Bowl in one of the great games in NFL
history, one that both teams seemed to have won several times. Both Dan Fouts
and Miami's Don Strock passed for more than 400 yards. The Chargers had and
blew a 24-0 lead. But for many, the indelible impression is tight end Kellen
Winslow being carried off the field, exhausted from his heroic effort.

Judy Sweet, UC San Diego athletic director: The UC San Diego athletic program
flourished under Sweet, the first woman to become athletic director at a school
that had a combined men's and women's program in 1975. But it wasn't until the
'80s that the Tritons exploded on the NCAA Division III scene. UCSD teams won
11 national titles in the '80s, finished second 14 times and third 12 times.
During that span, UCSD had 300 All-Americans, 18 academic All-Americans and two
NCAA post-graduate scholarship winners. While the Tritons were making their
presence felt in Division III, Sweet was making an impact in the NCAA. She was
vice president of Division III from 1986-88 and became the first women to be
elected secretary-treasurer of the NCAA in 1989.

with a .702 (283-120) winning percentage, easily the best in the nation.
Multiple All-Americans included Louise Schwartz (1981, '82 and '83), Tammy Smit
('81, '82), Kristin Kilbourn ('83, '84), Molly Wheatley ('83, '84), Carol
Lipson ('86, '87), Janet Hughes ('86, '87) and Diana Clintworth ('88, '89).

UCLA. SDSU, which defeated UCLA twice during the regular season, led 1-0 when a
UCLA player fell, rolled under the net and over middle blocker Toni Himmer's

he became the Titans' coach in 1978. Branstetter's teams have dominated county
wrestling, winning the section 3-A title on the mat every year since 1982, when
3-A competition began. (The Titans had to forfeit in 1986 because they used an
ineligible wrestler.) That year Poway went on to win the state title and set a

Although Asian consumers have a reputation for frugality in their homelands,
where saving is encouraged, their Asian-American counterparts are avid shoppers
-- generally less concerned about price and convenience than they are about
quality, according to new research.
</P>
<P>
The findings are bound to renew the debate among advertisers and marketers
about how to best reach America's rich mix of Chinese, Japanese, Koreans,
Filipinos and Southeast Asian immigrants, as well as highly assimilated
Asian-Americans. Although such consumers are widely viewed by Madison Avenue as
a potentially lucrative market because of their comparatively high incomes and
education levels, differences in language and culture make them difficult to
reach, experts say.
</P>
<P>
"Most advertisers think that all they need to do is simply translate an English
ad to reach this market," said David Chen, executive vice president of the Los
Angeles advertising firm Muse Cordero Chen &amp; Baca. "But there are problems
with that; there are many differences among Asian people.
</P>
<P>
"I can understand advertisers being concerned with the difficulty," Chen said,
"but it's not a difficulty we cannot overcome. Themes like stressing quality
have universal appeal" among many Asian groups.
</P>
<P>
A study by the SRI/Gallup organization of Lincoln, Neb., found that in choosing
a product, 67% of 779 Chinese-American consumers surveyed ranked the quality of
the product more important than price, store location or service. Similarly, an
SRI/Gallup survey last year of 400 Japanese and Korean households in Southern
California found that while there were "significant" cultural differences
between the two groups, both "are upscale shoppers with rapidly expanding
purchasing power."
</P>
<P>
More recently, both Impact Resources of Columbus, Ohio, and the Find/SVP
research organization in New York found Asian-Americans to be avid shoppers who
are generally more concerned about product quality than the general population.
For instance, while price was more important to the total population than among
the 3,251 Asian-Americans surveyed in the Impact study, 54% of the
Asian-Americans said quality is the most important reason for selecting a men's
clothing outlet, compared to 50% of the total population.
</P>
<P>
Quality, of course, is a subjective concept, and it is still unclear to many
experts why Asian-Americans embrace certain brands or whether they will remain
loyal to them as they become more acculturated. Nevertheless, some marketing
specialists believe that companies should continue to direct special campaigns
at even highly assimilated third- and fourth-generation Asians, although
convincing advertisers of that approach has been difficult.
</P>
<P>
"We've been banging on the door since 1985, and now we're beginning to see
greater acceptance of the Asian market," said Greg Sullivan, president of Asian
Television Sales, a San Francisco company that sells advertising time on three
Asian-language television stations, including KSCI in Los Angeles. "What
advertisers don't realize is that if you are an Asian immigrant, 80% of this
stuff on TV you've never heard of."
</P>
<P>
Concentrated in three areas -- California, Hawaii and the New York metropolitan
area -- Asian-Americans represent a large and rapidly growing market.
</P>
<P>
The Asian population has increased 67% since 1980 in Los Angeles County alone,
according to a 1987 Census Bureau estimate. And because the mean family income
of Asian-Americans is about $10,000 higher than that of Latinos, their buying
power is substantially greater, said Holmes Stoner, head of Artesa Media
Services, a Los Angeles ad agency that specializes in marketing to Latinos and
Asians.
</P>
<P>
Yet, unlike Latino immigrants who come from countries closer to the United
States, Asians are not as familiar with the broad universe of American goods.
As a result, many Asian-Americans flock to a dominant brand deemed "the best"
by their immigrant neighbors, experts say.
</P>
<P>
For example, studies conducted between 1986 and 1988 by SRI/Gallup found that
40% of Chinese consumers surveyed used Tide laundry detergent, 44% of Koreans
used Ajax cleaner and 70% of Japanese used either Crest or Colgate toothpaste.
No other brand had more than a 10% share in each of those product categories.
</P>
<P>
As a result, many experts see a tremendous opportunity to instill brand loyalty
and grab a large share of the Asian-American market by trumpeting the quality
or the prestige of their product to newly arrived Asian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
In advertising to the general public, for example, Metropolitan Life Insurance
Co. of New York runs ads featuring the comic strip character Snoopy saying,
"Get Met; it pays." But in a special campaign directed at Chinese- and
Korean-Americans, the company stresses its prestige, as well as Asian values
such as financial security and family responsibility. Instead of showing
Snoopy, the ads shows several massive office buildings owned by Metropolitan
Life.
</P>
<P>
"It's a more tangible identification of where our financial strength lies,"
said William Orton, a marketing executive with Metropolitan Life. "We did a
fair amount of market research in terms of what major themes would appeal to
the Asian community . . . We emphasize the prestige of dealing with a company
that was here yesterday and will be here tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Las Vegas hotels such as the Desert Inn and Caesars Palace have held
Chinese New Year parties, advertised on Asian-language TV and put on other
glossy promotions stressing the quality and prestige of their hotel's
accommodations to entice both Asian-American and foreign tourists. Caesars also
has marketing offices throughout Asia -- as well as in heavily Chinese-American
Monterey Park.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian community is a significant market for Caesars Palace; we try to
emphasize (to them) the elegance and ambience of our world-renowned resorts,"
said Jack Leone, a vice president at Caesars World Inc.
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T has taken a somewhat different approach. Last year, it became the
first U.S. company to air a regional television commercial with entirely
Japanese dialogue, said Mark N. Burgess, AT&amp;T's acting director for
international advertising. The 30-second ad, which had English subtitles, shows
a Japanese-American man calling long-distance to a colleague in Japan to relate
a joke told to him by his daughter.
</P>
<P>
Some Asian-American advertising executives, as well as the 157-page study
published in December by Find/SVP, prefer AT&amp;T's general market approach,
saying it's a waste of money to specifically target the Asian-American market.
They say Asian cultures are too different to reach efficiently with one kind of
campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Even though Asian people who come here have their own ethnic television, the
majority are watching regular network TV," said Clifford Yuguchi, president of
the Los Angeles advertising firm Bozell/Yuguchi Inc. "What companies ought to
do is pull off some of those white people and show more Asians."
</P>
<P>
Deborah Ching, executive director of the Chinatown Service Center in Los
Angeles, says she, too, would like to see more Asian-Americans on TV. But she
said she is turned off by some efforts that have "racist and sexist" depictions
of "Asian men as less than masculine and Asian women as exotic, desirable and
subservient." She cited as particularly offensive the Singapore Airlines'
"Singapore Girl" commercial that shows attractive female flight attendants
serving passengers.
</P>
<P>
Bob Candiotti, a spokesman for Singapore Airlines, responded: "It's true that
the presentation of Singapore girl has been one of our ongoing ad campaigns for
several years. To us, the Singapore girl is symbolic of our high level of
service. Their uniforms are actually quite modest; they wear ankle-length
dresses. We do not view the ads as being sexist or racist."
</P>
<P>
Although many marketers say they are moving away from unfavorable Asian
caricatures, there are still slip-ups and outright mistakes.
</P>
<P>
Playboy magazine once wished Chinese celebrants "Year New Happy" in a full-page
newspaper ad. And Filipinos -- the nation's largest Asian-American group -- are
sometimes mistakenly lumped with Latinos by marketers because Filipinos often
have Spanish surnames.
</P>
<P>
A more practical problem in reaching the Asian market is the lack of national
media. Unlike Spanish-language television, which has two national broadcasting
networks, there is no national Asian TV. Instead, regional systems -- such as
KSCI Channel 18 in Los Angeles and KTSF Channel 26 in San Francisco -- provide
programming in areas with large Asian populations.
</P>
<P>
The print medium is even more fragmented. In Southern California, there are at
least 15 Vietnamese-language newspapers, more than a dozen Chinese newspapers
and three Japanese papers.
</P>
<P>
"Unless you are willing to get in there and get your hands dirty, the
(Asian-American) market can be really intimidating," said Stoner of Artesa
advertising. "You can't go out there with a typical kind of ad and try to be
all things to all people."
</P>
<P>
Indeed, although Find/SVP agreed with other experts that Asian-Americans have a
"commitment to obtaining products and services noted for having the 'best'
quality" the study went on to conclude that: "In reality, each of the separate
Asian-American ethnic groups is a separate ethnic market. The only
characteristic they all have in common is their 'American-ness.' And it is only
through their 'American-ness' that the various groups can be reached through
the same marketing campaign."

A DOZEN WHO SHAPED THE 80S
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's image as a pacesetter held up fairly well in the 1980s in the
world of business and economics. Californians were a force for dramatic change.
</P>
<P>
Some achieved change on a grand scale -- inspiring a revolution in economic
policy or transforming corporate finance. Some of the change may seem minor,
but it altered our daily routines and our life styles. Some business people
built firms that are monuments to America's spirit of enterprise; others
brought companies to ruin and became symbols of corporate recklessness.
</P>
<P>
Here is a sampling of California residents who gave American business a 1980s
makeover -- making it better, or worse, or just more fun.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ARTHUR B. LAFFER
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, Arthur B. Laffer's name was a household word. The crusading
analyst was a leader of the supply side movement, a band of ideological
outsiders who stressed lower tax rates as the key to economic growth.
</P>
<P>
But the outsiders became insiders in Ronald Reagan's White House. Laffer's
famous mathematical curve gave the president an intellectual tool to justify
tax cuts. And the efforts were rewarded when Congress slashed taxes in the
Reagan years, dropping the top individual rate to 33% from 70%.
</P>
<P>
Critics have blamed Laffer and other tax-cut advocates for the federal budget
deficit -- estimated at $152 billion in fiscal 1989 -- which has weakened the
U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
But Laffer maintains that the cuts succeeded in stimulating economic growth and
raising federal revenue; the deficit has persisted, he argues, because Congress
failed to control spending. "The supply side won," he said last year. "We won."
</P>
<P>
These days -- when not tending to his exotic collection of plants and animals
-- Laffer, 49, spends most of his time on business travel. He is chairman of
Laffer, Canto &amp; Associates, an economic consulting firm and merchant bank
in La Jolla, and lives on a 17-acre mountain retreat in San Diego County.
</P>
<P>
Despite a lower profile, he has kept a hand in politics. He mounted an
unsuccessful bid in 1986 for the Republican senatorial nomination. Last summer,
he was among a group of experts who advised President Bush on economic matters
at a Camp David meeting. And in October he helped Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-Ga.)
fashion a proposal to cut the capital gains tax, which prevailed on the House
floor. JONATHAN PETERSON

INFLATION RATE TO SETTLE AT 4% IN 1990, S&amp;P SAYS;
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: PRICES FOR AUTOMOBILES, FOOD AND CLOTHING ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN FLAT.
GAS HEATING, INSURANCE AND HEALTH-CARE COSTS COULD RISE.

<P>
The inflation rate for 1990 is likely to remain in the 4% range after an
initial surge early in the year, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The December cold wave will leave us with a January hangover of higher prices
for heating oil, other energy, and fresh fruits and vegetables," the financial
services company said in its semiannual consumer price forecast.
</P>
<P>
"Prices will return to their recent 4% track. By late in the year, the soft
economy should push consumer price inflation even below that figure."
</P>
<P>
S&amp;P warned that the inflation trend, however moderate, will raise concern
at the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
"Even with a soft economy, the Fed will continue to watch the inflation
measures very carefully," the report said, stressing that the Fed has failed to
bring the inflation rate close to the zero level during the past seven years of
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Cars and air fares are the indicators that will contribute the most toward
keeping the inflation rate down, S&amp;P said.
</P>
<P>
"Domestic automobile prices will remain flat or decline in 1990. . . .
Slackening consumer demand will cause prices on many 1990 models to drop,"
Joshua Harari, S&amp;P auto analyst said.
</P>
<P>
"Airlines will not be successful in raising their fares more than 1% to 2% in
1990, and Eastern Airlines may continue to offer discounts in an effort to
rebuild its traffic to prestrike levels," predicted Thomas Canning, S&amp;P
airline analyst.
</P>
<P>
S&amp;P analysts also expected prices for clothes and food items to remain
under control.
</P>
<P>
"Stable raw material, a flood of imports and a sluggish overall consumer
market" will keep clothing prices at least at a stable level or possibly drive
them lower, the report said. Food prices are projected to increase by 4% next
year, down from 6% in 1989, with only luxury items and tomato products --
suddenly in high demand -- likely to go up.
</P>
<P>
"An oversupply of restaurants -- more than 80,000 franchise chain outlets in
the United States -- will also keep the price of eating out in check," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Major items expected to increase in price are gas heating, insurance rates and
health-care costs, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Consumers should be prepared to shell out 8% to 9% for natural gas home fuel
costs next year," the report warned, adding some good news for electricity
consumers who should see only a small 2% rate hike.
</P>
<P>
But oil industry analyst Edward Graves predicted that drivers would get a break
as gasoline prices drop following a softening in crude oil prices "in early
1990 from their current $21 a barrel to $19 a barrel."
</P>
<P>
Graves predicted that overproduction by the 13 members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries would drive prices down, with the cartel's output
remaining at 23.5 million barrels a day, for a stagnant demand of 21 million
barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Medical bills should increase by more than twice the projected rate of
inflation, in the double-digit range, reflecting expensive drugs, and cuts in
Medicare and Medicaid programs, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The soaring health-care costs will be matched only by property and casualty
premium hikes, in the 10% to 12% range, with insurers likely to work their way
around legislation aimed at capping the rates.

AT&amp;T RINGS IN DECADE WITH STATE RATE CUT
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new year and new decade spell lower telephone rates, effective this
morning.
</P>
<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph cut its prices for long-distance calling
within California by an average of 8.6%, an annual savings to AT&amp;T
customers of $113.3 million.
</P>
<P>
The company earlier announced a $300-million reduction in tolls for calling
between states and abroad, also effective New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
Most local callers in the state also get a price break today.
</P>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission ordered Pacific Bell's rates cut
$391 million a year, effective Jan. 1, saving the residential customers about
$1.15 on the typical $26 monthly bill.
</P>
<P>
That reduction will appear as a percentage credit subtracted from January and
subsequent bills until the PUC gets around, later this year, to recalculating
the specific price changes for local services provided by Pacific Bell and the
state's second largest local carrier, Thousand Oaks-based GTE California.
(GTE's rates, which were sharply lowered a year ago, will start the new year
unchanged.)
</P>
<P>
The AT&amp;T rate cut will reduce the cost of a 5-minute, weekday call between
Los Angeles or San Diego and San Francisco to $1.06 from $1.20. A 10-minute
call anywhere in the nation will cost up to $2.50. Since Monday is a holiday,
daytime rates are discounted by 33% to 47% after 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T spokeswoman Linda McDougall attributed most of the reductions to state
and federal regulators. All but $7 million of the California cut stems from a
1985 order by the PUC that began a seven-year reduction in what long-distance
carriers pay local phone companies for completing calls and a corresponding
increase in what local customers pay Pacific Bel and GTE California.
</P>
<P>
The interstate reduction is based on a similar cost shift ordered by the
Federal Communications Commission, which regulates interstate service. Phone
customers now pay a $3.50-a-month "subscriber line charge" to compensate local
phone companies for revenue they used to collect from long-distance carriers.
</P>
<P>
In all, AT&amp;T rates for calling within California have dropped 45.5% in six
years, while interstate rates fell 40%. AT&amp;T's long-distance competitors
have generally cut their rates proportionately.

BMI Grants HBO One-Month License Extension: Broadcast Music Inc. has agreed to
grant a one-month extension of its license to Home Box Office Inc. "at a
substantially higher fee."
</P>
<P>
The agreement came in negotiations between representatives of HBO and BMI. BMI
said that the issues raised in the lawsuit filed on Dec. 28 are still
unresolved and that unless the parties could reach agreement in January, the
litigation will continue. BMI filed suit against HBO to obtain a preliminary
injunction to prevent it from using BMI repertoire on the Home Box Office
channel after HBO's license expires Dec. 31.

$10-Million Settlement for Gold Investors: The owner of two defunct gold
investment firms agreed to repay more than 250 investors $10 million to settle
two U.S. District Court suits accusing him of being unable to deliver on
contracts for thousands of ounces of gold. William M. Moreland of Weldon,
Calif., will pay back investors at a rate of $300,000 per month beginning in
April, said Marge Erickson, an assistant regional director of the Federal Trade
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Most of the refund stems from an FTC case against Moreland charging that he
sold gold contracts during 1986-88 that were unlikely ever to be delivered
through his two Beverly Hills units, Continental Trading International Ltd. and
Axiom III. Moreland neither admitted nor denied the allegations. (Filed August
8, 1989, Case No. CV89-4708)

ROCKY MOUNTAIN WEST RECEIVING TOURISM BOOST FROM FAR EAST;
</P>
<P>
TRAVEL INDUSTRY: AMERICA'S MOUNTAIN STATES HAVE BENEFITED FROM A MAJOR PUSH TO
ATTRACT ASIAN TOURISTS TO THE REGION'S SCENIC VIEWS, FORESTS AND NATIONAL
PARKS.

In every way but one, the slick new magazine that just hit the stands looks
like every other travel mag you've picked up on airplanes and in doctors'
offices. The articles consist of hyperbolic prose about "mountain splendor" and
"natural wonders." The lavish color pictures show off Colorado's most scenic
mountains, forests, rivers and national parks, and the advertisements promote
hotels, restaurants, dude ranches and ski resorts.
</P>
<P>
But this new journal, Colorado Gaido, is written entirely in Japanese, and the
only newsstands where you can buy it are in Tokyo, Nagoya, Fukuoka and other
Japanese cities.
</P>
<P>
Colorado Gaido ("Colorado Guide") and its sister publication, Oregon Treiru
("Oregon Trail"), both published by a Portland firm called Pacific Gateways,
are key elements of a major new thrust across the Rocky Mountain West to
attract tourists, and their money, from the nations of the Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
"American travel markets have started focusing on the Pacific Rim as the
high-growth area . . . the first priority," said Max Ollendorf, director of
market development for the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration. The
strongest push, he added, comes from the Western states.
</P>
<P>
Manifestations of the new drive are evident throughout the region. On the ski
slopes at big resorts like Deer Valley and Snowbird, you now see trail signs in
Japanese as well as English. At the airport in Las Vegas, tour companies quote
prices for their Grand Canyon sightseeing flights in yen as well as dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the casinos at Las Vegas, you can now play Asian games of chance like Pai
Gow and Sic Bo. At the edge of a forest not far from downtown Portland sits a
perfect Japanese tea house, complete with tatami floors and sliding shoji
doors.
</P>
<P>
The effort to attract Asians is part of a larger pattern of change that is
transforming the economic structure of the mountain West. With energy, mineral
and timber markets in the doldrums, the Western states have been moving away
from traditional extraction industries toward the attraction industry --
tourism.
</P>
<P>
"People have discovered that you can make more from a forest by leaving it in
place and charging visitors to ski through it than you can by cutting it down
and selling the timber," observed Sen. Timothy E. Wirth (D-Colo.).
</P>
<P>
Because tourism is one of the fastest-growing industries in every Western
state, it was natural to look for new markets. And for the states on the
Pacific side of America, a natural place to look was the booming economies on
the other side of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the travel councils of eight Western states pooled their money to
fund a new promotional outfit called "Visit USA West," which exists for one
purpose: to sell Asians on the natural wonders of the Rocky Mountain and
Pacific Coast states.
</P>
<P>
The sales effort seems to be scoring points. The number of Japanese tourists
visiting Wyoming jumped this year to 8,000, double the figure for 1988,
according to the state's Travel Development Office. Japanese skiing at resorts
in Utah increased from "essentially zero" two years ago to 3,000 last season,
the state Travel Council reports.
</P>
<P>
The trend has been a boon in a part of the country that missed most of the
1980s expansion. And since the money that foreign tourists spend here is
counted as "export revenue" in national trade accounts, every skier from Tokyo
schussing down Ajax Mountain at Aspen helps offset the U.S. trade deficit with
Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism is second only to aircraft and space equipment in total export
revenue," said Jill Collins of the federal Travel and Tourism Administration.
Foreign tourists spent an estimated $37.1 billion in the United States in 1988,
a huge 25% increase over the year before. That means that foreign tourism is
America's fastest-growing export commodity. And the Pacific Rim is the
fastest-growing market for this "export."
</P>
<P>
Although state tourism officials here all talk hopefully about drawing visitors
from Taiwan, South Korea and Australia, the Pacific Rim market today is, for
all intents and purposes, the Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
For some states, this is nothing new. Hawaiian hotels have done a thriving
trade in Japanese tour groups and honeymooners for two decades now. California
has always been a big draw, and Alaska also has had a fairly large Japanese
tourist trade.
</P>
<P>
But there was no such tradition for Oregon, a state whose name the Japanese
have difficulty both pronouncing and spelling (a geography book used in
Japanese schools shows a state called "Olegon"). And so Oregon's Division of
Tourism set out to create an instant tradition.
</P>
<P>
The state paid for the filming of a sentimental dramatic movie, "Oregon Nikki"
("Oregon Diary"), which tells the story of a young Japanese boy living in
Oregon who falls in love with the state and its natural beauty. The two-hour
film is shown annually on the national Fuji Television network.
</P>
<P>
The result? Recognition of the name "Oregon" among Japanese adults went from
23% in 1986 to 78% this year. And the state broke all records by drawing about
60,000 Asian tourists, mostly Japanese, in 1989.
</P>
<P>
For most Western states, however, appealing to Japanese tourists means breaking
long-established routines. The standard route for Japanese travelers coming to
Los Angeles has followed a path known in the Japanese travel trade as the
"Golden Triangle." It consists of various stops around Los Angeles --
Disneyland, Universal Studios -- followed by a trip to Las Vegas, with a side
trek to the Grand Canyon, followed by a stop in San Francisco and then the long
flight home.
</P>
<P>
To break that habit, the Western states are busily advertising such
off-the-triangle wonders as Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks, Colorado
dude ranches and Salt Lake City's Temple Square. Much of this effort is aimed
at tourists who have been to the United States once. "Many Japanese on their
second visit don't want to go back to the same places again," explained Kasho
Furuya, director of Pacific Rim sales for Las Vegas-based Scenic Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most successful campaign was the major promotion called "89 in
'89." Created by Osamu "Sam" Hoshino of Utah's travel division and adopted by
six major tour packagers in Tokyo, it took Japanese tourists along U.S. Highway
89, the two-lane route sometimes called the most beautiful highway in America.
The route starts at Glacier National Park on the Canadian border and winds
south through Wyoming and Utah, passing near several other major parks before
its terminus at the north rim of the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
Skiing is one of the major tourist businesses of the mountain region, but this
fact has been lost on the Japanese until recently. Japanese skiers traveling
overseas have traditionally gone to Europe or the Canadian Rockies. That, too,
is beginning to change, thanks to major sales efforts by the big Rocky Mountain
resorts.
</P>
<P>
At Utah's Deer Valley, for example, Japanese skiers are greeted by Japanese
hosts when they arrive. The resort provides Japanese-speaking ski instructors
and Japanese-language restaurant guides.
</P>
<P>
The number of Japanese skiers choosing Colorado seems almost certain to
increase now that Japanese investors have purchased two of its biggest resorts,
Breckenridge and Steamboat Springs.
</P>
<P>
To win the Japanese market, American travel destinations have to be creative.
Dorothy Maitland, who owns a travel agency in Kalispell, Mont., has learned to
be creative during the past five years while making Tokyo-to-Montana packages a
key part of her business.
</P>
<P>
When Maitland first got the idea, she said, she was stymied by the fact that
the Japanese like to see the sights from a train. "I said, 'This is Montana.
The only train we've got is Amtrak from Seattle to Chicago, and that goes
through here in the middle of the night'."
</P>
<P>
After stewing over this dilemma for a while, Maitland hit on the solution. She
printed up a Japanese brochure promoting the midnight rail journey as a
romantic adventure: "the Moonlight Express."
</P>
<P>
And it worked. "We're selling tours on that moonlight train almost every day of
the summer," she said. "And our Japanese customers are buying like mad."

CANADIANS SWELL SALES ALONG U.S. BORDER;
</P>
<P>
RETAIL: A STRONGER CANADIAN DOLLAR HAS HELPED BOOST U.S. SALES. BUT SOME BORDER
RESIDENTS ARE ANNOYED BY THE SWARM OF FOREIGN SHOPPERS.

NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y.
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canadian shoppers have made this holiday season jolly for U.S. retailers, but
some residents are feeling a lack of good will toward fellow shoppers from
across the border.
</P>
<P>
Low U.S. prices and a comparatively strong Canadian dollar have caused
Canadians to throng grocery stores, liquor marts and factory outlets throughout
this border city.
</P>
<P>
"The prices -- check it out," said Manny Hilario, 23, who drove 100 miles from
Brampton, Ontario, to shop at the Factory Outlet Mall one recent Saturday.
Outside, in an overflowing parking lot, Ontario plates outnumbered New York
plates more than three to one.
</P>
<P>
The crowded lots, long checkout lines and delays entering Canada on the area's
three international bridges have caused tempers to rise at times.
</P>
<P>
A group of six Niagara Falls residents announced recently that they were
forming a group called "People Against Canadian Shoppers" to press local
merchants to deal with the problems.
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing against them (Canadians) personally, but we do think something
could be done to improve the situation for everyone," Steve Hughes, a spokesman
for the group, told the Niagara Gazette.
</P>
<P>
Hughes said his group is circulating petitions blaming Canadians for everything
from litter and rudeness to unsafely transporting gasoline across the border in
extra tanks.
</P>
<P>
That effort, in turn, has prompted U.S. business and tourism officials to
hasten to assure Canadians that they are still welcome.
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to blow this out of proportion and make out that there's a major war
going on," said Ray Wigle, spokesman for the Niagara Falls Convention and
Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The convention and visitors bureau and the Niagara Falls Area Chamber of
Commerce have urged businesses to clean up the trash and expand checkouts.
Local governments have been asked to increase traffic control in order to
reduce the complaints.
</P>
<P>
Local Canada Customs officials have asked the agency that operates the
international bridges to expand the customs facilities and are trying to
persuade Ottawa to allocate more staff.
</P>
<P>
Same-day shopping traffic across the Rainbow and Whirlpool bridges has
increased by almost 60% over the past four years, and at the Lewiston-Queenston
bridge, the main route to major Canadian cities such as Hamilton and Toronto,
traffic is up 107% over that period, said John Johnston, district manager for
Canada Customs operations in Niagara Falls.
</P>
<P>
Theories abound as to why the number of shoppers has multiplied, though the
year-old U.S.-Canada free trade pact isn't considered a direct cause. The
agreement has reduced wholesale tariffs on several categories of merchandise
but has not yet affected the duties paid by individual shoppers at the border.
</P>
<P>
Still, free trade may have subtly boosted cross-border shopping by helping to
strengthen the Canadian dollar. The Canadian dollar trades at about 85 U.S.
cents these days after falling as low as 70 cents earlier in the decade.
</P>
<P>
Niagara Falls, N.Y., also has a built-in price advantage because western New
York is one of the cheaper regions of the United States, but Niagara Falls,
Ontario, is an extension of the pricey Toronto metropolitan area, Wigle said.
</P>
<P>
Price is not the only attraction of the United States, some Canadian shoppers
said.
</P>
<P>
"In groceries, anything new they come out with (in the United States) is in
Canada the year after," said Lisa Morrice of Hamilton, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
U.S. grocery chains began advertising heavily across the border in the past few
months after seeing the stronger dollar and the increased willingness of
Canadians to cross the bridges.
</P>
<P>
Canadian merchants say they can't compete with U.S. prices.

A DOZEN WHO SHAPED THE 80S

California's image as a pacesetter held up fairly well in the 1980s in the
world of business and economics. Californians were a force for dramatic change.
</P>
<P>
Some achieved change on a grand scale -- inspiring a revolution in economic
policy or transforming corporate finance. Some of the change may seem minor,
but it altered our daily routines and our life styles. Some business people
built firms that are monuments to America's spirit of enterprise; others
brought companies to ruin and became symbols of corporate recklessness.
</P>
<P>
Here is a sampling of California residents who gave American business a 1980s
makeover -- making it better, or worse, or just more fun.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MICHAEL MILKEN
</P>
<P>
Michael Milken arguably has had a greater impact on American business in the
1980s than anyone else. The 43-year-old trader radically transformed the world
of American finance by pioneering the $210-billion market for high-risk,
high-yield debt securities known as junk bonds -- and then landed squarely at
the center of the nation's biggest securities fraud case.
</P>
<P>
In fostering the junk bond market, Milken helped touch off an unprecedented
wave of merger and acquisition activity. Some entrepreneurs built vital
businesses with the money that Milken raised for them, and corporate raiders
were able to launch takeovers against industry giants by using almost no money
of their own. In many instances, as companies sought to defend themselves or as
raiders dismantled their prey, workers were laid off by the thousands.
Investment bankers and shareholders often walked away rich and happy.
</P>
<P>
When Milken started work as a bond trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert in New
York, a junk bond was debt issued by a "fallen angel," a once highly regarded
company that had fallen on hard times. Small and mid-size companies were rarely
able to borrow from anyone but a bank, and even that wasn't easy. But Milken
helped hundreds of smaller firms issue bonds in the public markets in the way
that big companies did.
</P>
<P>
For a long while, the business was good for both Drexel, which became a
financial powerhouse, and Milken, who earned $500 million in one year and ranks
among the wealthiest men in America. But Drexel and Milken were charged with
massive securities fraud. Drexel has pleaded guilty and paid a huge fine; its
business is suffering. As for Milken, he is fighting a 98-count indictment on
similar matters and hopes to stay out of jail. He maintains his innocence and
has started a new financial advisory firm. KATHY M. KRISTOF

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SOL PRICE
</P>
<P>
Back in 1976, San Diego retail executive Sol Price opened a bare-bones,
cash-and-carry store in an aircraft-hangar-sized building in an industrial
section of his hometown. It marked the birth of a store, as well as the birth
of an idea -- warehouse membership outlets that cater to small-business owners
and consumers who want rock-bottom prices.
</P>
<P>
By the early 1980s, that idea was transformed into a booming industry. But even
as a flock of copycat companies opened similar stores, the Price Club chain
remained a leader.
</P>
<P>
Price, now in his early 70s and no longer running the company, was the first to
recognize that "a real basic need of small-business customers was not being
met," said Sarah Stack, an analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
And, she added, "He saw that consumers were able to forgo some creature
comforts to get the best price possible."
</P>
<P>
Price also was early to recognize, among other things, the value of what is
known as vertical integration, Stack said. One example: After the Price Club
started offering optical lenses, it also got into the business of grinding
lenses so that it could offer the product at a lower price.
</P>
<P>
Thomas H. Tashjian, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities, said another
important innovation by Price was the introduction of a customer newsletter
about developments at the stores. Such newsletters, he said, now are regarded
"as a vital component of the business." STUART SILVERSTEIN

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A. W. CLAUSEN
</P>
<P>
A.W. (Tom) Clausen -- as BankAmerica Corp.'s once and future chief executive in
the 1980s -- was the architect both for one of the decade's biggest corporate
declines and one of its biggest comebacks.
</P>
<P>
He was blamed for many of BankAmerica's troubles earlier in the decade, such as
leaving its Bank of America unit with a huge portfolio of Latin American loans
that soured, as well as building an inefficient, bloated bank with an outmoded
computer system.
</P>
<P>
BankAmerica's problems went beyond those loans: Key executives left amid
turmoil, morale was low, the bank suffered an embarrassing mortgage scandal,
and its stock was battered on Wall Street. So vulnerable was BankAmerica that
First Interstate Bancorp launched an unsolicited $3.4-billion takeover bid in
late 1986 that BankAmerica ultimately fought off.
</P>
<P>
Yet it also was Clausen who returned to lead BankAmerica through a
Chrysler-like turnaround. Clausen, 66, had left BankAmerica, the San
Francisco-based parent of Bank of America, in 1981 to head the World Bank.
BankAmerica was a shambles when Clausen was asked by its board to return in
1986 to replace his successor, Samuel H. Armacost, who resigned under fire.
</P>
<P>
Under Clausen, BankAmerica became profitable again by slashing costs, improving
loan quality, selling assets and pushing consumer banking. More important,
Clausen brought in a team of key executives to work the turnaround, notably
former Seafirst Corp. President Richard M. Rosenberg, 59, who is now
BankAmerica vice chairman and the executive considered most likely to succeed
Clausen.
</P>
<P>
But the clout that BankAmerica once enjoyed worldwide has diminished from the
days when it was the nation's largest bank.
</P>
<P>
Clausen has not indicated when he may retire. Observers speculate that he may
leave in a year or two. JAMES BATES

THE STAR ATTRACTION OF HOLLYWOOD'S CHINA CLUB;
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: CELEBRITIES OFTEN PLAY AT THE LATE-NIGHT HOT SPOT, WHERE EVERYBODY
-- EVERYBODY WHO CAN GET IN -- IS SOMEBODY.
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The long-haired young man seemed a bit fazed on a recent Monday night when the
doorman at Hollywood's China Club wouldn't let him enter the nightclub. After a
trip to the side door, the man returned to explain to the doorman that he'd
been told he would be allowed in.
</P>
<P>
"OK, so what's your name?" asked the doorman, a tall New Yorker in a beige
trench coat.
</P>
<P>
The young man paused. "Well . . . Axl."
</P>
<P>
The doorman stiffened. "That's good enough for me," he said, sweeping aside the
people waiting to clear the entry for one W. Axl Rose, the lead singer of Guns
N' Roses.
</P>
<P>
It's all par for the course at the China Club, the hottest nitery in town since
it opened in August, where class division is the rule -- and perhaps the
attraction. Before the Axl incident, as the club prepared for its 10 p.m.
opening, the same doorman gave those waiting a convoluted explanation of how
the entry system worked.
</P>
<P>
"If you're on the guest list, get in this line," he said, indicating the
20-person queue to the left of the entrance.
</P>
<P>
"If you're not on the guest list, you have to wait here," he continued,
motioning to a slightly longer line at the right. "Now, if you only think
you're on the guest list, you might not be. So, unless you know you're on the
list, don't stand in the guest-list line."
</P>
<P>
Sound inviting? It is to many in Hollywood who all-too willingly stand in line
-- especially on Mondays when a star-studded jam session draws celebrity guests
only a notch below the rumors -- so they can pay $10 to be sardined around the
elongated horseshoe bar or on the dance floor -- where it's too crowded to
dance and too loud to talk -- and pay five bucks a pop for mixed drinks. (The
"pro-jam" will be held tonight and, beginning next week, on Tuesdays as well.)
</P>
<P>
"The thing is, everybody's somebody here," said Stephen Eads, who has served as
general manager of the club since it opened in August. But, of course, some
people are more somebody than others at the China Club, a three-level,
400-capacity facility at the Selma and Argyle site that once housed the
punk-era Cathay de Grande.
</P>
<P>
Though the club is used frequently for record companies to showcase
up-and-coming artists, it's the Monday-night jams that get the buzz going. A
few weeks ago, Elton John hopped on stage to lead the band through nine songs.
Michael Bolton and Rick James are among those known to turn up. Even rocker
wanna-be John McEnroe plugged in his guitar recently.
</P>
<P>
And the rumors!
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Jeff Beck, maybe Phil Collins, maybe Eric Clapton," said club publicist
Joe D'Ambrosio as the cozy, understatedly Chinese-themed main room started to
fill up. On this occasion the rumors proved a bust (as was one about Paul
McCartney the week before) -- the crowd had to "settle" for Sam Kinison and
Gary Busey destroying "Wild Thing," plus the now-standard guest appearance of
Who bassist John Entwistle. Word persisted through the evening that Beck was in
the club, but that proved untrue.
</P>
<P>
Of course, some people are more somebody than others, and that is certainly, at
least in part, what draws the lesser somebodies.
</P>
<P>
"The general public is used to being slighted, watching premieres and parties
on TV that they can't go to," said Belissa Cohen, who covers the night life for
the L.A. Weekly. "So when they see it right in front of them, they're
privileged to be there. If you see Madonna walk ahead of you to the front of
the line, you know you're in the right place."
</P>
<P>
Indeed, on that Monday, they did see Madonna, with close-cropped dark hair,
walk by with Warren Beatty. The celebrated pair took their places at a table in
one of the elevated areas that flanks the narrow ground-floor room where the
nightly entertainment takes place. Others in the star contingent this night
included Justine Bateman, actor Danny Aiello -- his son Ricky was the doorman
that night. And Lakers owner Jerry Buss and party held a table throughout the
night separate from, though in sight of, the hoi polloi. A guarded VIP room
downstairs held more celebrities.
</P>
<P>
"They make it comfortable here," Buss said while the loud house band, the Nasty
Survivors, took a break and made conversation possible. "The security's real
good -- you don't have to have your bodyguards."
</P>
<P>
But, for all that, the China Club is fairly egalitarian, as these clubs go.
There's none of that trendy snobbery about style that people accustomed to the
likes of Vertigo expect. Both the celebs and the common folk tend to favor the
casual look here.
</P>
<P>
"We're in the rock 'n' roll business, not the snob business," insisted Danny
Fried, who co-owns both this club and its New York namesake, which has served
as a successful, celebrity-filled hot spot for five years. "We don't play the
'We don't like your clothes' games. . . . The only times it gets tight at the
door is when it's too busy.
</P>
<P>
"We're not a trendy kind of place," he continued. "We are in the music
business. I don't cater to kids; we cater to an older, sophisticated crowd.
That's why I'm so happy that top musicians have frequented the place. They know
if they play they're gonna sound good and play to a crowd that appreciates it."
</P>
<P>
Jerry Buss appreciates it.
</P>
<P>
"It's the only place (like it) with live entertainment in L.A., which is
strange for the entertainment capital of the world, that we would have to
import that from New York," Buss said.
</P>
<P>
And even those who have to wait in line outside, often for more than half an
hour, appreciate it too.
</P>
<P>
"I've been in L.A. for a year, and this is one of the best places I've been,"
said Erika Hjelm, a fashion designer from Switzerland, as she stood with her
brother Jonas, a USC student.
</P>
<P>
And the pair insisted that they'd like the club even if it weren't a great
place for star-gazing.
</P>
<P>
"I'd still come even if there were no celebrities," said Erika.
</P>
<P>
Belissa Cohen agreed that it's more than being able to rub elbows with the
aristocracy that brings the public to the China Club.
</P>
<P>
"You can be in there without knowing that David Bowie and Axl are over there,"
she said. "Some people find the conservative atmosphere pleasant. That's enough
for them. They don't want to deal with the underground and the trendiness."
</P>
<P>
But, if not for the impressive guest list, you'd have to wonder if the club
could remain the hottest place in town. It certainly wouldn't draw the
paparazzi who stake out the club religiously.
</P>
<P>
"We give the club a lot of publicity," said celebrity photographer Al Ortega
during his vigil. "Stuff we shoot here gets published."
</P>
<P>
At 2:15 in the morning, after the club had closed, Ortega and several
colleagues were still working, coaxing a complaining Justine Bateman to
dutifully pose as she headed across Argyle to the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
For now, the China Club's magic is working. But even those who are impressed
expect it will wear off eventually.
</P>
<P>
"This is great," marveled one record industry executive, who asked his name not
be used because he might need to book some of his acts there in the future. "I
wonder how long will it last."

CRITIC AT LARGE: HOPES ARISE WITH THE DAWN OF A NEW DECADE
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Like birthdays, years divisible by 10 have a special aura about them. In the
case of our private birthdays, the aura gets darker and darker as the numbers
go up. Turning 50 has a chill about it, like a cloud passing the face of the
sun, and let us not speak of 60 at all.
</P>
<P>
The world's birthdays have no such darkening auras, and it is a small miracle
of our lives that no matter how dark things have been for the individual or the
world up through Dec. 31, New Year's Eve always carries the hope that things
will change for the better. The hope may be as thin as a penlight at the end of
a very long tunnel, as it has often been in wartime. But the hope is there,
because things have always gotten better before, or so you tell yourself as the
bells ring and the horns toot in the crisp night air.
</P>
<P>
Even in the hard, realistic light of New Year's morning, a guarded optimism is
at very least an allowable state of mind.
</P>
<P>
And if the old year has ended up in a rush of good news, personal or
collective, as this one surely has collectively speaking, then the new year
begins with a sense of possibility that is headier than any Champagne.
</P>
<P>
The year 1989, lately dead, and the ending decade have been memorialized and
analyzed to a true fare-thee-well. And seeing the bits of film and tape,
hearing the litany of new voices discovered and familiar voices gone still, and
glimpsing again the triumphs and the tragedies, it is impressive to realize how
much we've all borne witness to.
</P>
<P>
But, as Mort Sahl once remarked in an album title, the future lies ahead, and
the view from New Year's morning is indubitably ahead. Not to those
intimidating resolutions. Yes, yes; we're all going to eat less and exercise
more and save more and be better persons in each and every way, at least
through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Resolutions, unreal to begin with, tend to have rather short lives. On the
other hand there are hopes -- and the first day of any year is nothing if not a
time of hope -- that should last longer than the resolutions.
</P>
<P>
I hope, for example, that the movie makers will rethink the prevailing
conventional wisdom that only home runs count. Singles and doubles have a place
in the Hollywood scheme of things too. Those swollen budgets, averaging $18
million to $20 million but occasionally peaking at twice that or more, have
deprived the movies of one of their greatest strengths -- variety. Variety in
size, themes, tone, casting.
</P>
<P>
The argument always is that little pictures cost as much to distribute as big
ones so you're better off making big ones that have more selling points. The
trouble is that the big budgets carry timid compromises, like barnacles.
</P>
<P>
There are signs of hope already in the success of modest-cost films such as
"sex, lies, and videotape," "Do the Right Thing" and even, in its limited
showings, Kenneth Branagh's "Henry V." The hope at last is for more hope.
</P>
<P>
I hope the television networks read the handwriting on the screen about their
still-declining share of prime-time viewing. They are losing to cable, to
independents, to VCRs. Indeed, their share of viewing time may be even lower
than the measurers can measure.
</P>
<P>
And what, the networks might well ask, are their viewers viewing instead? Even
less objectionable programming, which is to say, even blander and more
derivative stuff? Not exactly. A lot more sports, certainly, on cable, which
feeds an evidently insatiable appetite in the society.
</P>
<P>
Beyond sports, what we watch appears to be a mosaic of what you can only call
the good stuff, films and specials for cable (the networks abandoned variety
shows too quickly), plays, documentaries, profiles, news in breadth and depth
and, not without a touch of irony, the best of what network television did in
the past, the excellence of which now also carries a heavy icing of nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
The networks' old quest for LOP (Least Objectionable Programming) is obviously
an inadequate response to the new challenge they face. The hope is that they
will try upgrading their offerings to a viewership that is now anything but
captive.
</P>
<P>
Television's not a wasteland; never was, entirely. There were oases in the
thinnest of times, and the medium's inventiveness and immediacy have at their
best been spectacular. The power of television's news coverage increasingly
shapes history as well as recording it. But even here the networks are under
siege from CNN and other quarters.
</P>
<P>
The hope, I think, is for a counteroffensive by the networks, taking risks and
showing their undoubted muscle, instead of cutting costs and plotting spinoffs.
</P>
<P>
I can't say I hope, but I wish that the pop music I hear seemed to originate
deeper in the soul. For a time in the '60s particularly, the voices of rock
spoke for a generation and reflected, early on, its angers and concerns, its
rejection of what it saw as outworn values but its essentially positive
aspirations for change.
</P>
<P>
Today much of what I hear, or read about, seems to me to reflect the
disenchantment of senders and receivers. It's hard not to sense a strained
quest for commercial novelty, preferably built on shock value. Cynicism
pervades the music, or probably more accurately the industry.
</P>
<P>
It seems no accident that the possibility of a Beatles reunion holds such
fascination for so many, or that the individual Beatle tours have done so well.
There is a terrific nostalgia for the (relative) innocence and the romantic
idealism that their music carried in the '60s when they owned the world.
</P>
<P>
It is also no accident that someone like Bruce Springsteen, who has a point of
view and whose attraction is therefore lyrical as well as musical, should
command such a following.
</P>
<P>
(I remember watching a 1965 rehearsal of the Byrds and a young man beside me
shouting, "This is it! Facade show business is dead!" It isn't; it just uses
megawatt amplifiers and wears artfully torn jeans.
</P>
<P>
My hope, I guess, is that out there somewhere are new composer-musicians who
are looking beyond a facile and fashionable cynicism to find new angers and
concerns. It may well be beyond them, but we can not give up the possibility of
change.
</P>
<P>
There is a banquet of subsidiary hopes lurking about.
</P>
<P>
I hope the theater will rediscover the lean, sophisticated musical as an
alternative to the overwhelmingly spectacular musical. I hope for the spirit of
Rodgers and Hart, as well as revivals of Rodgers and Hart.
</P>
<P>
I hope the Los Angeles Theatre Center will hang in there, while more and more
customers find their way to it and discover that it is a safe and exciting
oasis in an undeniably off-putting part of downtown. The operating losses have
not dimmed Bill Bushnell's daring as a producer, and I hope they never will.
</P>
<P>
I hope the writers of crime fiction will ease off on drunken private eyes and
serial killers; both are becoming not so much bores as trivializations.
</P>
<P>
To end on a more cosmic level, I hope -- no, I pray -- that Mikhail S.
Gorbachev holds his own against the troglodytic Old Guardsman who undoubtedly
lie in wait for him. He has diverted us all from a collision course with
catastrophe. The world is not free of terror or terrorists but it is
immeasurably saner than it was a year ago, and a hope for more of the same fits
this morning like none other.

HIDDEN POPULATION POSES CENSUS WINDFALL FOR CITIES
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a natural fear, and Quach Tho Ninh was no different than the rest. In
the grim months after the fall of Saigon in 1975, Vietnamese authorities would
conduct an occasional head count, marching house to house with automatic rifles
slung over their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
This was only a census, but the questions invariably strayed. Were you in the
army of the south? What are your beliefs? Your politics? Quach would always
give the correct responses, the answers that would keep him alive.
</P>
<P>
Now more than a decade has passed. Quach has come to Orange County, hoping for
a new life. One recent day, the 46-year-old immigrant was sitting in an
English-language class, grappling with strange new vowels and syllables, when a
visitor appeared -- a man from the U.S. Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
This, Quach soon realized, was different than the homeland. The census
employee, a slight Vietnamese man named Vong Ngo, softened up the class with a
few one-liners in his native tongue, then explained the importance of the
nationwide survey.
</P>
<P>
The spiel did the trick. Afterward, Quach, without fear, was eager to
participate in the U.S. Census.
</P>
<P>
Such small victories, however, could prove the exception rather than the rule
when the 1990 census is launched in late March. While the past decade saw
perhaps the greatest influx of foreign newcomers in Orange County's history,
many of those immigrants from south of the border and Indochina might go
uncounted in the upcoming national survey.
</P>
<P>
They are among the nation's hidden population, which also includes the
homeless: families tucked into garages or vans, and drifters with no fixed
addresses. Wary of the government and its emissaries, both recent immigrants
and the homeless typically are not counted in the U.S. Census.
</P>
<P>
Although the census missed about 1.4% of the overall U.S. populace in 1980, the
undercount was greater among minorities, with the rate of omission for black
and Latino inner-city residents pegged at 12%.
</P>
<P>
The undercount is unfortunate, since the census serves as an important
springboard for help. It bears directly on the distribution of about $30
billion in federal aid and millions more in state subsidies for a variety of
programs. Each city's share of that money is generally based on its numbers of
poor, homeless or unemployed people.
</P>
<P>
Federal officials contend that the 1990 census can overcome the daunting
obstacles to produce a reasonably complete count, even among immigrants and in
the pockets of poverty that lace Orange County and other communities. The
bureau has pressed ahead with a spate of programs to reach the types of people
who have been overlooked in past decades.
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, census officials will enlist the help of churches, schools
and social service agencies. Outreach specialists have been dispatched to give
presentations to community organizations, adult English-language classes and
Head Start groups.
</P>
<P>
Census officials also plan to hire temporary employees directly from the ethnic
minority neighborhoods, marching into apartment complexes and housing projects
to make a pitch for recruits. By tapping workers from the community, officials
hope to ease the tensions and worries of residents facing the census.
</P>
<P>
Orange County cities such as Santa Ana have also helped, promoting the census
with videos on local cable channels and distributing literature.
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau, meanwhile, is gearing up for an ambitious, one-night
campaign to count the homeless. Dubbed "shelter and street night," the special
push is expected to far surpass the bureau's past enumeration efforts, which
have focused on flophouses and other places of refuge.
</P>
<P>
But several problems persist.
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau's promotional literature in Spanish and other languages has
largely failed to materialize in district offices throughout the United States.
Aghast at the information gap, a nonprofit Latino group has stepped in to
provide pamphlets in Spanish for many regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
For the Indochinese communities in Orange County, local census officials have
resorted to producing their own literature, drawing up and photocopying
rudimentary pamphlets for distribution.
</P>
<P>
Beyond logistical glitches, critics also see problems with the census form. The
questionnaire comes only in English, with a small paragraph at the bottom
giving a toll- free number to order a copy in Spanish. The form is unavailable
in Vietnamese, Chinese or any of the scores of other languages spoken in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling is a lot of people will not even see the paragraph at the bottom
of the census saying they can request one in Spanish," said Berta Saavedra,
state census coordinator for the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education
Fund. "It could cause problems. And it's even worse for people who speak other
languages."
</P>
<P>
Census officials attribute such drawbacks mostly to a lack of funds. But they
insist the informational literature will be arriving at most district offices
in January. They also stress that residents who speak another language can get
help at special translation centers.
</P>
<P>
"It's a concern," said Fernando Tafoya, a census district manager in Orange
County. "But it's up to all of us on the local level to get the word out, and I
feel we've got all the bases covered. The literature is important, but what's
even more important is the personal contact we hope to establish."
</P>
<P>
Such a face-to-face approach could prove invaluable.
</P>
<P>
Undocumented immigrants, most of them Latinos settled in cities such as Santa
Ana and Anaheim, fear the census will be used by immigration officials to track
them down. (Illegal immigrants are counted by the census, despite repeated
efforts by some congressmen to repeal the practice.) Even those granted legal
status under the amnesty program are sometimes filled with distrust or don't
understand the benefits of being counted, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
New arrivals from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos carry not only fears imported from
their homelands, but a suspicion that the census might help housing authorities
root out large families packed into cramped apartments in immigrant enclaves
like Orange County's Little Saigon in Westminster.
</P>
<P>
"Most of our efforts have to be aimed at saturating the community with accurate
information about the census," said Father Jaime Soto, vicar of the Hispanic
community for the Catholic Diocese of Orange. "We need to get out the message
that the information is confidential, and that the census could actually help
them a lot."
</P>
<P>
The news is only beginning to trickle out.
</P>
<P>
Consider the case of Natividad, a 26-year-old Latino woman in Santa Ana. An
illegal immigrant who asked that only her first name be used, Natividad said
she did not know what the census is. The mother of four also said she feared
filling out government forms because of what she believes is the threat of
deportation.
</P>
<P>
But Maria, another undocumented immigrant, said she planned to participate in
the census, even though many of her friends are too frightened to be counted.
</P>
<P>
"My friends have a lot of concern that the census is a way the government can
find out we are here illegally," said Maria, 23, who learned about the
nationwide survey from a Spanish-language news program.
</P>
<P>
There are others just like them, in Anaheim, in Westminster, in Santa Ana and
Garden Grove. And that is where people like Vong Ngo come in.
</P>
<P>
A bespectacled 29-year-old with a wife and two children, Ngo came to the United
States as a boat person in 1980 after five years under the communist regime in
Vietnam. Now a community outreach specialist for the Census Bureau, he spends
his days combing the Indochinese communities throughout Southern California,
urging people to come forward and be counted.
</P>
<P>
So it was that he arrived one recent day for a presentation at Cambodian Family
Inc., a nonprofit community services agency in Santa Ana.
</P>
<P>
Talking in a mix of English and Vietnamese, Ngo stressed that the census is
confidential. Moreover, he pointed out how the count would actually help the
community. More money would come for day-care centers, for health care, for
sidewalks on a street.
</P>
<P>
"We have to explain it in terms of how it will help their own neighborhood and
family," Ngo said. "That's why these presentations are important. But there's
never enough. There is no way that we can spread out the message to everyone."
</P>
<P>
Across town, Tafoya was delivering a similar talk to a room packed with about
50 young Latino families at a community center. A murmur filled the room and
small children in hooded jackets squirmed at their parents' feet as Tafoya
spoke in English. But the audience grew attentive when he broke into Spanish.
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Tafoya talked of building bridges.
</P>
<P>
"You're sort of in their environment when you come out to these meetings," he
said. "It strengthens the relationship. And it helps that we're going to give
some of them a job with the census. The others know that their neighbor is not
going to do something to hurt them."
</P>
<P>
But it is a fragile trust. Some community leaders argue that unconnected events
such as an immigration sweep a few days or weeks before the census could
convince many immigrants not to participate. They have asked the Immigration
and Naturalization Service for a moratorium on sweeps in the months before the
census.
</P>
<P>
"If they decide to raid, it'll put a damper on a complete count," said
Saavedra. "These people don't understand that one hand of the federal
government doesn't always know what the other is doing. When they think of the
government, they think of the INS, IRS, FBI. It all begins to run together."
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau faces no less troubling a dilemma with the homeless.
Street-corner preachers and bedraggled bag ladies drifting on the periphery of
society often hold a chilling animosity toward any type of government
representative.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the 1990 count, census officials have been putting their heads
together with homeless advocates and others to pinpoint all the shelters and
street locations that need to be visited.
</P>
<P>
On March 20, the massive operation will begin across the country. Shelters and
low-cost motels will be visited between 6 p.m. and midnight. Streets will be
searched the next morning from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. Sleeping persons will not be
awakened, but enumerators will estimate as best they can the person's age and
race.
</P>
<P>
Even with such tactics, a percentage of the United States' hidden population
will likely remain uncounted, experts say. For many cities, that will mean less
federal money for streets, social services and other programs.
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, for instance, officials estimate that $2.5 million a year could
be lost during the coming decade if the city's estimated 50,000 Latino
newcomers are omitted. Officials in Los Angeles, which has an even greater
variety of needy immigrants, say their city stands to lose $12 million annually
if there is an under-count.
</P>
<P>
"It boils down to the fact that if we do not count everybody, these people will
not exist on paper," noted Santa Ana Councilman Miguel A. Pulido. "Everything
from reapportionment to tax dollars will be affected."
</P>
<P>
Eager to ensure an accurate tally, many state and city officials are pushing
for the Census Bureau to use a new technique it has developed to estimate the
nation's hidden population and adjust the census accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The concept is similar to a 100-year-old method for counting fish in a lake.
Immediately after the census, an intense recount will be conducted of 150,000
randomly selected households across the country, including neighborhoods that
have been habitually undercounted. By comparing the survey results against the
census, the percentage of residents not included in the original count can be
estimated.
</P>
<P>
The idea was initially endorsed by several key officials with the Census
Bureau, but the Reagan Administration rejected the technique, prompting
protests from critics who accused the president of playing politics.
</P>
<P>
As the critics saw it, the Republican president opposed the concept because of
a probable rise in population totals in areas that are Democratic strongholds.
As a result, those regions would gain Congressional seats and more federal
money.
</P>
<P>
Several large states and cities, including California and Los Angeles, sued to
reverse Reagan's decision. The result was a settlement in 1989 that created an
eight-member committee that will recommend whether the survey results should be
used to adjust the nation's population.
</P>
<P>
But politics could still come into play, the survey's advocates contend,
because the final decision, expected in mid-July, rests with Secretary of
Commerce Robert Mosbacher, a Republican political appointee.
</P>
<P>
While the intrigue continues in Washington, the mood in Orange County has
remained one of optimism, of hope that all segments of society will be counted
on April 1, Census Day.
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping the census will be the beginning of a reorientation in the way we
see ourselves here in Orange County," Father Soto said. "One of the critical
issues facing the county will be ethnic pluralism, how we choose to engage the
reality of who we are. The census could be a pivotal beginning to bringing that
reality to us and making us face it."

SITTING IT OUT: Those wanting to cheer on Orange County entries in today's Rose
Parade will be disappointed. . . . Despite a history of entries that extends,
with lapses, back to 1917 when Santa Ana first entered, there will be no float
from here this year. . . . "We're cutting back on all the frills," a Santa Ana
City Hall spokesman explained. Instead, the city will be represented by the
Santa Ana Winds Youth Band, appearing 110th in the line of march. Steve Emmons

WHAT'S NEW? From The Times Orange County in 1979: "The '70s are likely to be
remembered as the end of Orange County's free-wheeling growth . . . roads grew
more crowded. Environmental concerns led to constraints on development. Many
young adults lost the American Dream of owning a house. . . . Perhaps the
brightest note during the '70s was the rebound of Orange County's economy. . .
. Housing and transportation . . . will be Orange County's most goading issues"
of the '80s. . . . Sound familiar? Steve Emmons

It was a decade in which Laura Bradbury disappeared from a stark desert
campsite, a small boy survived an inferno set by his father, the county got its
first billionaire, septuplets were born, mountain lions attacked children and
an animal shelter was chosen to house the homeless. Winnie the Pooh went on
trial, Richard M. Nixon went to New York, Anaheim went up in smoke, the
Olympics came and went, and the price of a house went through the roof. Here's
a closer look at some of the events that made headlines in Orange County in the
1980s:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1983: The year of the Decade
</P>
<P>
TRAGIC MISTAKE:
</P>
<P>
Stanton Police Officer Anthony Sperl, called to an apartment because neighbors
had not seen the family for days, went in to investigate. Startled by a dim
figure brandishing a handgun, Sperl fired and killed Patrick Ridge, 5, who had
been left home alone by his working mother. Patrick had been holding a toy
revolver.
</P>
<P>
TRAGIC INTENTIONS:
</P>
<P>
Charles Rothenberg, a waiter on vacation from New York, checked into a Buena
Park motel room, put his 6-year-old son David to bed, doused the room with
kerosene, then set it ablaze and fled. David survived but was horribly burned
and faced years of plastic surgery and pain. His father, begging forgiveness at
his trial, was sentenced to 13 years in prison and is due for parole in
January.
</P>
<P>
CAUGHT AT LAST:
</P>
<P>
Two California Highway Patrol officers routinely stopped a car on Interstate 5
in Mission Viejo and found a dead Marine in the seat next to the driver, Randy
Kraft. That discovery ended a string of murders so long that prosecutors say
they may never know the total. Six years after his arrest, Kraft was convicted
of 16 murders, but prosecutors think that he may have committed 65 or more, the
most in U.S. history. The trial was the county's longest (13 months, with five
years of preparation) and most expensive (an estimated $10 million).
</P>
<P>
DENTISTRY DEATHS:
</P>
<P>
Dr. Tony Protopappas, who built a million-dollar practice based on painless
dentistry, was arrested and later convicted of second-degree murder after three
patients died from his anesthesia. Protopappas was an "unqualified, arrogant
man" who used methods as reckless as "shooting a gun into a crowd," his
prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
FIRST BILLIONAIRE:
</P>
<P>
Donald L. Bren bought control of the Irvine Co., moved to Orange County and
instantly became its biggest wheel.
</P>
<P>
LAST (BUT LONG) HURRAH:
</P>
<P>
Joan Irvine Smith, great-granddaughter of the Irvine, whose ranch once covered
one-fifth of Orange County's territory, spent three decades fighting for what
she considered her legacy -- the Irvine Co. stock she inherited. But she was so
at odds with new owner Bren that she decided to sell him her stock rather than
associate with him. Hers has been a lengthy exit, however. The lawsuit over the
selling price persists into the '90s.
</P>
<P>
PIER PRESSURE:
</P>
<P>
Huge waves from offshore winter storms ripped away a section of the Seal Beach
Pier. The waves returned three months later to finish the job, this time
tearing away the end of the Huntington Beach Pier, including the End Cafe. (See
"Goodby Again.")
</P>
<P>
LABOR OF LOVE:
</P>
<P>
Dennis Holland, working virtually single-handed for 13 1/2 years in his front
yard in Costa Mesa, hand-wrought a 100-foot wooden brigantine according to
19th-Century plans and christened it Pilgrim. As it slid into Newport Harbor,
2,500 people cheered and scores of boats tooted -- probably the biggest and
most festive launching crowd in the harbor's history.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Rest of the Decade. . .
</P>
<P>
CAUGHT AT LAST II:
</P>
<P>
The Night Stalker, who sneaked into homes to rape and murder, struck in Mission
Viejo and sent Orange County residents scurrying to buy guard dogs and guns
(1985). Both Mission Viejo victims survived, and the attack provided the clue
that broke the case. A 13-year-old boy's description of a suspicious vehicle
led police to a Texas drifter, Richard Ramirez. Convicted of 13 murders but
defiant to the end, Ramirez was sentenced to death four years later in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
INFERNO:
</P>
<P>
A tree swaying in a severe Santa Ana wind brushed a power line. The resulting
fire gutted an entire section of Anaheim. The epic blaze destroyed 50 buildings
containing 525 apartments and turned 1,200 people into instant homeless. The
damage was estimated at $50 million. Miraculously, no one was seriously injured
(1982).
</P>
<P>
INFERNO II:
</P>
<P>
Six months after the Anaheim conflagration, a brush fire erupted in Gypsum
Canyon behind Orange and spread to the nearby, very pricey Crest de Ville
community. Twelve homes were leveled there and three others nearby (1982).
</P>
<P>
TERRORISM AT HOME:
</P>
<P>
Alex M. Odeh, 41, regional director of the American-Arab Anti-Defamation
Committee, opened his office door in Santa Ana and was fatally injured by a
bomb. The FBI's suspicions fell on members of the Jewish Defense League, but no
arrests have been made (1985).
</P>
<P>
FERTILITY RECORD:
</P>
<P>
Patricia Frustaci checked into St. Joseph Hospital in Orange and delivered the
first septuplets in U.S. history. Although just three survived, the Frustacis
said they were blessed and returned to Riverside. After the worldwide hoopla
subsided, they sued the doctor who had administered fertility drugs (1984).
</P>
<P>
CHILDREN AS PREY:
</P>
<P>
It's called Caspers Wilderness Park, but no one took that literally until a
young mountain lion sprang from the brush and carried away 5-year-old Laura
Small. Laura, rescued almost immediately, was left partially paralyzed and
blind in one eye. Seven months later, Justin Mellon, 6, was similarly attacked.
The park was closed and a hunt begun. When the park reopened three months
later, visitors were warned to stay with their children (1986).
</P>
<P>
SURF RIOT:
</P>
<P>
There were 100,000 people on the beach the final day of the Ocean Pacific Pro
Surfing Championships in Huntington Beach when a group of beach-goers behind
the grandstand became rowdy, then violent. Soon a full-scale riot was under
way. By darkness, riot police had cleared the beach, but not before several
police and lifeguard vehicles had been burned, more than 40 people injured and
13 people arrested (1986).
</P>
<P>
OLYMPIC FEVER:
</P>
<P>
Lots of the excitement and some of the pageantry of the Los Angeles Olympics
spilled over into Orange County. The biggest happening: bicycle races through
Mission Viejo (1984).
</P>
<P>
MISSING CHILD:
</P>
<P>
Three-year-old Laura Bradbury of Huntington Beach disappeared from the family
campsite at Joshua Tree National Monument, apparently a kidnap victim, touching
off what grew into a nationwide search captained by her father (1984). Five
years later, her family continued to deny the possibility of her death despite
DNA tests showing bone fragments found near the campsite "were consistent with
Laura Bradbury".
</P>
<P>
MURDER MYSTERY:
</P>
<P>
Edward Lee Cooperman, a Cal State Fullerton physicist, was found shot to death
in his office. But why? A student, Vietnamese immigrant Minh Van Lam, said it
had been an accident. Cooperman's friends said it had been an assassination
prompted by Cooperman's humanitarian and scientific aid to Communist Vietnam.
The judge scoffed at the assassination theory and convicted Lam of involuntary
manslaughter (1984).
</P>
<P>
MONEYGATE:
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, based in Irvine, spent five years on the financial
fast track of junk bonds and high-risk real estate before federal regulators
took it over (1989) and calculated that it could cost taxpayers $2 billion to
bail it out. After Lincoln's collapse, Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of
Lincoln's parent company, found himself the subject of congressional, civil and
criminal investigations. Joining him on the hot seat were politicians whose
favor he had cultivated -- including U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston of California.
</P>
<P>
MUNIGATE:
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest judicial investigations in California focused on Harbor
Municipal Court in Newport Beach, where six judges came under scrutiny (1989).
In the end, Judge Brian R. Carter, suspected of exchanging courtroom favors for
sex, retired rather than undergo a formal disciplinary hearing. Evidence
included a taped conversation between Carter and a prostitute in which he
stated, "This is the one you owe me." And Judge Calvin P. Schmidt was publicly
rebuked for giving preferential treatment to a friend's daughter and making
improper campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
GATESGATE:
</P>
<P>
A jury heard weeks of allegations that Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates had
used his investigators to harass political opponents by tape-recording their
conversations and trumping up charges against them. Their verdict: Gates must
pay $189,894 to the private investigator who filed the suit.
</P>
<P>
SECOND THOUGHTS:
</P>
<P>
Cinnamon Brown, 14, confessed to murdering her stepmother and was sentenced to
prison (1985). Case closed? Not quite. After three years in stir, she conceded
to investigators that she had taken the rap for her father out of "love and
loyalty." Officers arrested David Arnold Brown, an Anaheim Hills businessman,
who they said took out $835,000 in life insurance on his wife, persuaded his
daughter to confess to the murder, then married his dead wife's sister. Later,
more charges were filed against Brown: trying, while in jail, to hire the
murders of key prosecution figures. David Brown's trial is pending.
</P>
<P>
TRAGIC MISTAKE II:
</P>
<P>
Beverly Jean Ernst, 27, said she wanted only to lie down and asked her
boyfriend to watch her 3-month-old twins napping outside in a car in Garden
Grove. But by the time she checked on them five hours later, they were dead
from the summer heat, estimated to have reached 120 degrees inside the car.
Tried for involuntary manslaughter, she was convicted of child endangerment and
sentenced to four years in prison. "It's not fair," she said to her attorney
(1986).
</P>
<P>
TRAGIC MISTAKE III:
</P>
<P>
A Costa Mesa police helicopter, helping to pursue a suspect, passed the chase
to a Newport Beach police helicopter as the suspect's car crossed over the city
limit. But within seconds, the two helicopters collided and crashed. All three
people aboard the Costa Mesa craft were killed. Miraculously, the two Newport
officers survived (1987).
</P>
<P>
DEADLY CLOUD:
</P>
<P>
About 7,500 people fled their homes and jobs when an arsonist touched off a
fire in an Anaheim pesticides and fertilizer warehouse (1985). More than 80
chemicals, some of them lethal, were released over sections of Anaheim,
Fullerton and Placentia. Only emergency workers were allowed in the area for
four days. The owner of the warehouse, the Larry Fricker Co., later agreed to
pay $200,000 for the cleanup. More than 300 claims were filed, alleging lost
work time, respiratory infections and burdensome hotel, food and medical bills.
</P>
<P>
HOME, v.EET HOME:
</P>
<P>
The cost of houses, which began to spiral up in the '70s, went through the roof
in the '80s. The average price of a house was about $150,000 at the start of
the decade and was flirting with $400,000 at the end.
</P>
<P>
NEAREST MISS:
</P>
<P>
At John Wayne Airport, Air California Flight 336 tried to land on the runway
where Air California Flight 931 was taking off, forcing 336's pilot to belly-in
his Boeing 737 at the last second. The plane was mangled, but of the 104
aboard, just 33 were injured, and no one was killed (1981).
</P>
<P>
CHANGING FACE:
</P>
<P>
The 1980 census put the county's minority population at about 22%, but a
decade-long migration of Mexicans, Vietnamese and El Salvadorans raised the
figure to an estimated 27%, and still climbing.
</P>
<P>
TRAFFIC:
</P>
<P>
It was a problem in 1980. It was a bigger problem in 1989. With two
transportation taxes defeated, population still growing and cars still
everyone's favorite wheels, there was no solution in sight.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Newsmakers
</P>
<P>
John Paul Bostrom, 13 months, and Eugenie Wilhelmina Bostrom, 2 weeks, went in
for a medical checkup, the first step in events that eventually blew their
secret: They were the out-of-wedlock children of family man and right-wing
moralist John G. Schmitz, 51, once a congressman but then state senator from
Corona del Mar. Their mother, Swedish-born Carla Stuckle, 43, had been one of
Schmitz's students at Santa Ana College and a Republican volunteer. Stuckle
said that Schmitz, married 28 years with seven children, eventually offered to
pay $200 a month in child support but told her he couldn't pay more and still
maintain his wife's life style (1981).
</P>
<P>
Andrija Artukovic, frail from 85 years of living, was seized at his home in
Surfside and ordered sent to Yugoslavia, becoming the highest-ranking Nazi war
criminal ever extradited from the United States (1985). The Yugoslavs said that
while Nazi interior minister of Croatia, Artukovic ordered entire town and
village populations executed. Before a firing squad could carry out his
sentence, Artukovic died of old age in a prison in Yugoslavia (1988).
</P>
<P>
Mel C. Yorba, 17, of Riverside, became Disneyland's first murder victim (1981).
</P>
<P>
W. Patrick Moriarty, an Anaheim fireworks manufacturer determined to prevent
anti-fireworks laws, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to influence
legislation. He wound up indicted and pleading guilty to bribing government
officials and giving kickbacks to bankers (1985). Called one of the most
significant political corruption cases in recent California history, the
Moriarty affair led to indictment of city council members, bankers and one
state legislator.
</P>
<P>
David P. Jacobsen of Huntington Beach, a hospital administrator held hostage in
Lebanon for 17 months, returned home to an outpouring of welcomes and
patriotism. Released after U.S. arms shipments to Iran, Jacobsen praised Lt.
Col. Oliver L. North as a hero, criticized news media probing of the
transaction and at the White House tried to protect President Reagan from
hostile questions by ordering reporters to "back off" (1986).
</P>
<P>
Father Lawrence Jenco was also released by Lebanese terrorists after 19 months
in captivity and was assigned by the Catholic Church to temporary duty in
Orange County (1986). Asked what he thought of the arms shipment that freed
him, the priest said: "I can't comprehend why we have to ship arms and kill
innocent men, women and children. It doesn't make sense to me. . . . I would
have said, 'No, I will stay.' "
</P>
<P>
Sheryl Lynn Massip repeatedly tried to kill her 6-week-old son and finally
succeeded by running over him with the family Volvo. Her attorneys said she
suffered from postpartum psychosis, a rare maternal disorder that causes severe
anxiety, delusions and sometimes violence. A jury convicted her of
second-degree murder (1988), but the trial judge overturned the verdict. "I
didn't have any choice but to find her insane," Superior Court Judge Robert R.
Fitzgerald said. "She was bonkers."
</P>
<P>
Wally, the 5 1/2-foot alligator who had lived in Upper Newport Bay for at least
three years, was finally caught on a street in Irvine, much to the relief of
local water birds. Too small for a zoo, Wally was sent to live in a
herpetologist's private pond (1985).
</P>
<P>
Roger R. Stanton, a Fountain Valley city councilman, launched an impossibly
low-budget campaign against incumbent county supervisor Philip L. Anthony
(1980) -- and won, apparently buoyed by Anthony's indictment for laundering
campaign money. By decade's end, Stanton still firmly held the seat.
</P>
<P>
Jose Luis Razo Jr., 21 -- pride of the La Habra barrio, fund-raiser for cancer
victims, Boys Club leader, youth award winner, star high school scholar and
athlete, scholarship winner, above-average student and linebacker at Harvard --
</P>
<P>
was also La Habra's Ski Mask Bandit. Razo confessed (1987) to a string of armed
robberies during vacation breaks from Harvard, saying "I'm a home boy now. At
Harvard, I didn't fit in." He later recanted his confession but was convicted
and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Timothy Waisanen, former aide to TV evangelist Robert H. Schuller, blew the
whistle on his old boss, revealing that fund-raising letters and photographs
supposedly made during Schuller's trip to China had been faked months before
Schuller departed. Schuller refused to comment, but his public relations
spokesman, oblivious to the pun, called mailing the letters "a clerical error"
(1987).

<P>
The Irvine Northwood Little League All-Stars, winning 18 straight playoff games
-- 12 of them by shutouts -- became the national champion and America's hope of
dislodging powerhouse Taiwan at the 1987 Little League World Series. Final
score: Taiwan, 21, Northwood 1 -- the worst shellacking in the series' history.

On the other hand, the North Irvine Bobby Sox Minors won their second straight
national softball championship (1987).

A gay couple were tossed out of Disneyland after caught dancing together on a

dropped its no-same-sex dancing rule.
</P>
<P>
UP AGAINST THE WALL, BEAR:
</P>
<P>
Disneyland's Winnie the Pooh was hauled into Superior Court by parents of a
9-year-old girl who said Pooh had slugged their daughter at the park, causing
$100,000 worth of bruises and headaches. In full costume, Winnie demonstrated
that it had been an accident, nothing more than a smack from an ear when Pooh
turned around. The jury deliberated 21 minutes and found the bear innocent
(1980).
</P>
<P>
UP AGAINST THE WALL, YOUR HONOR, WHENEVER IT'S CONVENIENT:
</P>
<P>
Former Irvine Mayor Art Anthony beat his wife and nicked her with a bullet from
a .45-caliber automatic pistol, sending her fleeing to the home of Police Chief
Leo Peart. Peart, taking charge of the case, decided to let Anthony stay home
that night, visited him twice the next day, allowed him to voluntarily check in
to a psychiatric hospital and did not attempt an arrest for almost two days.
Peart said later that moving too fast might have provoked a shoot-out (1981).

FOR ONE THING, THE RENT'S LOWER:
</P>
<P>
Theodore Streleski, a Stanford mathematician who beat a professor to death with
a hammer, chose to remain in prison rather than be paroled to Orange County. "I
have nothing against Orange County," he said. "I understand it's got the best
solid tax base in the state. But it's not my place."
</P>
<P>
FREEWAY FEEDING FRENZY:

Bank robbers fleeing police tossed cash onto the Costa Mesa Freeway, touching

GOOD CITIZEN AWARD:
</P>
<P>
Deanna Young, 13, fresh from a lecture at church against drug abuse, turned in
her parents to Tustin police for possessing about an ounce of cocaine and a
small amount of marijuana (1986). Her parents, a bartender and a federal court
clerk, later said they were proud of Deanna. Deanna said, "I'd do it again."
</P>
<P>
KING OF THE JAILBIRDS:
</P>
<P>
Willie Ray Wisely, convicted murderer and jailhouse lawyer supreme, set the
record for longest stay in Orange County Jail -- more than seven years. Because
he acted as his own attorney, he was provided with a private double cell, law
books, a personal computer, a TV set, a telephone and a wife. (He secretly
married his court-appointed law clerk during a jail visit.) Wisely was finally
sent to Folsom Prison (1988) but continues to file motions occasionally.
</P>
<P>
POLLGATE:
</P>
<P>
Afraid that the Democrats would cheat, the Republicans got in the first punch.
Blaming rumors that Democrats would truck illegal aliens to the polls, county
Republican Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes approved stationing uniformed security
guards at polls in 20 mostly Latino precincts of Santa Ana (1988). County
officials ordered them away and local Latinos filed lawsuits, but the
Republican candidate, Curt Pringle, narrowly won his seat in Congress, and no
one was charged. Eventually a bill was passed in Sacramento making uniformed or
armed guards at the polls a felony, and local Republicans paid $400,000 to
settle the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
WAIT, LET ME EXPLAIN:

Irvine applied for federal funds to convert an animal shelter into housing for

were in one.
</P>
<P>
To the Orange County Performing Arts Center, nurtured by land and money
donations from C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons. Its opening (1986) ushered Orange
County into the cultural big leagues, according to its promoters.
</P>
<P>
To Rudy Castruita, who grew up in a Spanish-speaking home in El Monte, earned a

He moved to Hawaii (1981).
</P>
<P>
To Orange County International Raceway, the last drag strip in Southern
California, lost to a business park development (1983).
</P>
<P>
To affordable housing. Bowing to pressure from developers, the county
supervisors scuttled its 5-year-old program that required builders to produce
some lower-cost homes (1983).
</P>
<P>
To C. David Baker's political career. So intent on bankrolling his campaign for
a Republican congressional nomination, he forged the name of a Superior Court
judge to a check and got caught (1988).

Goodby Again (and Again and Again)...
</P>
<P>
To the Huntington Beach Pier. A hurricane removed its end (1939), then winter

days later made a U-turn for home, victims of seasickness (1980).
</P>
<P>
To the Gay and Lesbian Student Education Union at Fullerton College. Rather
than be forced by court order to recognize the group, the Board of Trustees
withdrew recognition from all campus clubs (1980). The decision still stands,
but G&amp;L eventually got onto campus by obtaining student government approval
(1988).
</P>
<P>
To Richard L. Fluharty, Eleazar Gonzales, Ly Hung, Michael D. Taylor and Steven
Wilson, who checked out of Orange County Jail by rappelling four stories using
a rope of knotted bedsheets (1988). One got no farther than a jail roof, one
surrendered, two made it to Denver, and Taylor got as far as Chicago, where
authorities believe he stuck up a jewelry store for $450,000 in loose gems.
Within eight months, all were back in the slammer.

STREET SMART: A TICKLISH ROUTE FROM DISNEYLAND
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Street Smart:
</P>
<P>
For years there has been a major problem experienced by Disneyland visitors who
wish to go north on the Santa Ana Freeway.
</P>
<P>
After exiting the park and proceeding north on West Street, they must turn
right onto Ball Road, then work their way over to the left-hand lanes so that,
once they've crossed the freeway, they can make a left turn across the
westbound lanes and onto the freeway entrance.
</P>
<P>
Caltrans is building a new bridge where Ball Road crosses the freeway. It is my
understanding that when this new bridge is completed, Disneyland visitors will
still have to work their way over to the left lanes on this new bridge so they
can make a left turn across traffic on Ball Road to reach the freeway entrance.
</P>
<P>
Why would anyone spend millions of dollars on a new bridge without making
provision to safely handle the many cars traveling east on Ball Road that would
like to enter the northbound Santa Ana Freeway?
</P>
<P>
Richard C. Martin
</P>
<P>
Anaheim
</P>
<P>
That freeway entrance is a doozy, the kind that makes motorists wish they were
safely back on the Autopia in the Magic Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
But officials at Caltrans have a ready explanation for why they won't be
eliminating the troublesome left turn on Ball Road.
</P>
<P>
Given their druthers, the agency's highway engineers admit they would like to
install a cloverleaf-type freeway entrance that would siphon eastbound traffic
off Ball Road's right-hand lane and swing it on a curving strip of asphalt down
onto the northbound Santa Ana Freeway. No muss, no fuss and no left-hand turn.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the land needed for such a serpentine freeway ramp is occupied
by a motel. Caltrans officials say the agency cannot justify purchasing the
property and removing the motel just for a new freeway ramp.
</P>
<P>
Instead, they plan to do the next best thing. As part of the bridge
construction, Caltrans will erect a new left-turn signal and add an extra
left-turn lane off Ball Road onto the northbound Santa Ana Freeway.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the new turn lanes and traffic light, which will be
synchronized with signals on nearby Harbor Boulevard, will help all those
Mouseketeer groupies and Tinkerbell fans get onto the freeway a whole lot
easier.
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart:
</P>
<P>
Like everyone in the Los Angeles Basin, I have become increasingly concerned
with our traffic problems. The only solutions I see being offered appear to
involve large sums of money and long-term projects.
</P>
<P>
The solution is to reduce the number of vehicles on the road. The obvious
answer is car-pooling. Unfortunately, most people give up on the idea because
of the hassles involved in coordinating everyone.
</P>
<P>
I would like to see local newspapers run advertising at no charge to commuters
listing where people live and work, using the coordinates from a Thomas
Brothers map book. This would provide a quick reference for people who live and
work near one another and who have similar work schedules to form a car pool.
</P>
<P>
Many large companies use a similar system for their employees. I am suggesting
that this could be tried on an areawide basis.
</P>
<P>
Much has been written about the number of single-driver vehicles on the
freeways. I think this plan could be a very logical way to reduce that number
and speed up traffic on our freeway system, and it could be done with the least
cost to the taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
Thomas C. Moore
</P>
<P>
Orange
</P>
<P>
It's nice to see someone thinking about promoting car-pooling, which many
transportation experts say is an important weapon in the battle to ease traffic
congestion in the region.
</P>
<P>
Those same experts, however, say that putting together such a commuter bulletin
board in local newspapers might prove ineffective, since many residents are
squeamish about public listings of their addresses and phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
Also, there is already a program to serve this purpose. It is called Commuter
Computer, and it offers motorists information about others who live and work
near them in an effort to encourage the formation of car pools.
</P>
<P>
Those interested can call Commuter Computer at (714) 636-RIDE for information
on car pools, van pools and the nearest park-and-ride lot.
</P>
<P>
A very valid point. Seat belts save lives. Just ask any CHP officer or
ambulance driver. Street Smart encourages motorists to use them, even if they
sometime wrinkle your tie or blouse.

HOMICIDES SET RECORD IN COUNTY
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From a 4-year-old boy slain in a hail of gang gunfire to a topless bar owner
ambushed inside his limousine, a record number of people became homicide
victims in Orange County during 1989.
</P>
<P>
The 155 killings recorded for the year by the Orange County coroner's office up
to New Year's Eve, far surpassed the previous record of 131 homicides set in
1985. The 1989 total easily topped the 129 slayings in 1988, 98 in 1987 and 112
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials studying the grim statistics say they cannot pinpoint
any specific causes for the nearly 18% rise in the number of people who died at
the hands of others in 1989. They can only note a general increase in violence
in society and evidence that a growing number of people carry guns.
</P>
<P>
"Homicides are just one of those things (for which) there are no explanations,"
Garden Grove Lt. Chuck Gibbs said.
</P>
<P>
Certainly it is difficult to find a satisfying explanation for the death of
4-year-old Frank Fernandez Jr., caught in the gang cross-fire in September as
he stood in his family's driveway in Garden Grove. Or for the kidnap and murder
of 9-year-old Nadia Puente of Santa Ana in March. Or for the slaying of
12-year-old Jacalyn Calabrese, who was shot and killed in the Mall of Orange
last month as a schoolmate showed off his .25-caliber pistol.
</P>
<P>
While many of last year's murders seem particularly senseless, others were
carried out with the precision of a gangland murder.
</P>
<P>
Horace Joseph McKenna -- known as "Big Mac" -- was shot through the rear
passenger window of his limousine as it pulled up to the gate of his expansive
estate in Brea's Carbon Canyon. McKenna, a former California Highway Patrol
officer and a 6-foot, 6-inch bodybuilder, was under investigation for hidden
ownership in several nude and topless bars at the time of his death. No arrests
have been made.
</P>
<P>
While no tally was available for each city, Anaheim appeared to have posted one
of the largest increases in homicides. There were 28 killings in 1989, an
increase of 10 over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Joseph T. Molloy said that little changed in his city last year in
terms of the provocation for homicide. Fights between family members and
drunken brawls were again the most common situations that led to homicide in
the county's most populous city.
</P>
<P>
"In a lot of the homicides we're investigating, the victim and suspect knew
each other," he said.
</P>
<P>
For all the concern and publicity about drugs and gangs, only four of the
killings appeared to be directly linked to the narcotics trade, he said. And
echoing the comments of police officials in other cities, Molloy added that
gang activity accounts for relatively few killings around the county.
</P>
<P>
While Anaheim, the Sheriff's Department and Santa Ana report an upswing in
homicides, Garden Grove actually experienced a reduction. Gibbs said the city
had four fewer homicides in 1989, recording eight as the year drew to a close.
</P>
<P>
But just as no one has a good answer for why the county's homicide rate surged
last year, Gibbs is at a loss to explain the good news in his city.
</P>
<P>
"We've been real fortunate," Gibbs said. "I don't know why. (There's) no way to
track this stuff or predict it."

NUN WHO HELPED POOR IS DEAD AT 81
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sister Henrietta Sauvageau, who spent more than 60 years ministering to the
poor, the homeless, the addicted and the deaf in Orange County, has died at age
81.
</P>
<P>
Her fellow Sisters of St. Joseph described her as an irrepressible person to
whom it was nearly impossible to say no. She had a knack for organizing and
would go to great lengths to help anybody in need, other nuns said.
</P>
<P>
"I used to say, 'I'm not going to go out with you any more, Sister Henrietta;
you're a perfect beggar,' " recalled Sister Angela Lemay, 85, a friend from
childhood. "But it was always for the poor, never for herself."
</P>
<P>
Once Sister Henrietta learned that St. Joseph Hospital had purchased new
mattresses, and she resolved to give the old ones to poor families.
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'But how are you going to move the mattresses?' " Sister Angela said.
"She said, 'Never you mind.' There was a circus in town, and somehow she got
the men to help her." The mattresses were indeed delivered -- in a circus van.
</P>
<P>
"She would get anything and everything from anybody," Sister Angela said. "You
couldn't say no to Henrietta."
</P>
<P>
Born Mathilde Sauvageau in 1908 in Manchester, N.H., she went to work in a shoe
factory after completing the eighth grade. According to Sister Angela, who
worked in the same factory, she gave most of her earnings to a local religious
order, and on Saturday nights persuaded her friend to come with her to an
orphanage, where they would put little girls' hair up for Sunday curls.
</P>
<P>
As a child, she suffered from polio, and once confided that she had been told
by a doctor that she would not walk again, Sister Rose Marie Redding said. "She
said, 'Oh, yes I will. If God wills it, I will walk again.' She promised God:
'I won't complain about my legs if I can walk again.' And even when her legs
hurt her, she never did complain."
</P>
<P>
After hearing about nuns who were ministering to homeless immigrants in Los
Angeles, she came west and entered the Sisters of St. Joseph convent in Orange
in 1927, taking her final vows in 1933.
</P>
<P>
Sister Henrietta taught school in Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego for
about 15 years, and was stationed permanently in Orange in 1945.
</P>
<P>
She began a home for women with alcohol or chemical dependency and founded
programs for the hearing-impaired, Sister Rose Marie said. And in 1975, she
volunteered to help the first Vietnamese refugees who arrived after the fall of
Saigon and were sent to Camp Pendleton.
</P>
<P>
For the past few years she had suffered from diabetes and had difficulty
walking, but she got around in an electric cart, and "never missed a party,"
Sister Rose Marie said. Sister Henrietta continued to visit women in the
dependency program until she suffered a stroke in early November. She died
Saturday of kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
Sister Henrietta is survived by an older sister, Bertha Marston, who lives in
the convent's infirmary, and by a stepsister, nieces, nephews and cousins.
</P>
<P>
A Rosary prayer service will be held at 5 p.m. Thursday, followed by a Mass of
the Resurrection at 7 p.m. in the Motherhouse Chapel, 480 S. Batavia St.,
Orange. Burial services will be at 9 a.m. Friday in the chapel, with burial in
Holy Sepulcher Cemetery in Orange.

RAMS PUT THEIR FOUL-WEATHER REPUTATION ON ICE WITH VICTORY

<P>
The cold, rainy weather for Sunday's wild-card game was supposed to favor the
Eagles, who are accustomed to playing on the 100-yard slip-and-slide that is
the Veterans Stadium artificial turf in a downpour.
</P>
<P>
But it was the Eagles, not the Rams, who couldn't hang onto the football. The
Rams fumbled once. Philadelphia fumbled six times.
</P>
<P>
The Rams hope this will help put an end to their reputation as fair-weather
football players.
</P>
<P>
"If we could get (cornerback) Darryl Henley out from in front of the heater,
we'd be all right," linebacker Mel Owens said. "He's the only guy who sits in
front of the heater.
</P>
<P>
"But, really, I'm from Michigan and believe me, nobody gets used to cold and
rain. Nobody. I don't care who you are. Not even the birds. They seek shelter
too.
</P>
<P>
"It's the same for both teams. You put on a little sweat shirt and a little
glove and you play football."
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Kevin Greene was a little more succinct in his appraisal of the
Rams' cold-weather rap.
</P>
<P>
"Can the beach boys play in cold weather?" he asked, rather loudly, of the
media mob crowded around his locker. "Well, can the beach boys play in cold
weather?" he asked again, even louder.
</P>
<P>
A number of reporters mumbled something akin to "yes," and Greene seemed
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
The Rams also hope they have dispelled another popular notion: that a team with
a defense ranked 21st in the league has no business being in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
"We have the lowest-ranking defense in the playoffs and a lot of people said we
didn't deserve to be here," linebacker Mike Wilcher said. "That gave us a lot
of incentive today."
</P>
<P>
Once again, Greene took a more emotional tact on that subject.
</P>
<P>
"Stiff all that, man," he said. "Play with your heart. It was a question of
will today and we maintained that mentality. We had the desire and we kept
fighting. And we had no lulls in the whole 15 rounds."

FIRING BACK AT EX-EMPLOYER;
</P>
<P>
ATTORNEY DISCUSSES LAWSUITS OVER WRONGFUL TERMINATION
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gregory Crouch, Times staff writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donald Bott, 55, of San Clemente claimed he was terminated from his 17-year job
as Santa Ana's director of personnel in 1983 because of his age and his efforts
to expose wrongdoing in city hiring. Six months ago, a jury decided it didn't
believe him. But last week, Superior Court Judge Leonard Goldstein said he did
and overturned the jury's verdict, awarding Bott $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
 The case is a good example of the difficulties involved in proving a wrongful
termination lawsuit. Courts and legislatures are providing an increasing amount
of protection for employees from indiscriminate firings but many of the laws
are complicated. Nearly all require anybody terminated to act quickly if he or
she hopes to win a verdict against a former employer.
</P>
<P>
 Tustin attorney Harris E. Kershnar has represented more than 100 individuals
who have sued their former employers for wrongful termination. He spent the
early part of his career defending employers from such suits but changed sides
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
 "I'm philosophically more comfortable representing the underdog," he said.
</P>
<P>
 Kershnar, 36, now serves on the American Bar Assn.'s Equal Employment
Opportunity Committee and is a former chairman of the labor law section of the
Orange County Bar Assn. He graduated from the law school at UC Berkeley. He
recently spoke with Times staff writer Gregory Crouch about how fired employees
can vindicate themselves in court.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. What types of wrongful termination cases have you typically argued?
</P>
<P>
A. They are a varied lot. One was a case involving a large oil company that
conducted searches of employees' vehicles and lockers as well as the employees
themselves. The employee I represented was discharged because a marijuana
cigarette was found in his car. The jury reached a verdict in favor of the
employee on the grounds the employer violated an expressed agreement not to
discharge people without good cause. Plus, there was an inadequate showing that
the marijuana was his. And there wasn't much in the way of precedent to
establish that drugs found inside a car amounted to grounds for terminating
someone when there was no indication he had ever used drugs at work or ever
reported to work under the influence of drugs.
</P>
<P>
On a different subject altogether, I handled an age discrimination case against
a trucking company where there was a manager who thought my client was too old
to be a driver and didn't hesitate to communicate that in front of other
employees. My client was fired for a minor driving accident, which would not
have typically resulted in the termination of a driver. The case was settled on
terms we thought were quite favorable. And I had a case where an employee was
fired for refusing to fire somebody else who declined to take a lie detector
test. It's illegal to require someone to take a lie detector test, and my
client was told to fire an employee who exercised his right to decline such a
test. My client told the president of the company it was illegal for him to
fire this person and, in turn, my client was fired. My client won a verdict on
the basis his firing was contrary to the public policy of the state of
California.
</P>
<P>
Q. How common is it for somebody to get fired?
</P>
<P>
A. Exceedingly common. People who feel they have been improperly terminated
call up virtually on a daily basis. Nearly everyone who is fired feels that it
was improper or unfair, but the real question is how many have a legal remedy,
because what's unfair does not equal what is unlawful. I don't have a
percentage for you, but a small percent of the unfair terminations fall into
categories where the law provides a remedy.
</P>
<P>
Q. So what are the different categories?
</P>
<P>
A. The primary area is in civil rights laws covering age, race, sex, religion,
national origin and physical handicap. Firings based upon any of those
categories is prohibited based upon the Fair Employment and Housing Act, which
is a California statute. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is
not prohibited by the terms of the acts but there are serval cities that have
municipal ordinances that prohibit discrimination against gays and lesbians,
including Laguna Beach, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
Q. What if the reason for somebody's dismissal doesn't coincide with one of the
civil rights classifications?
</P>
<P>
A. There are a number of individual pigeonholes. It's illegal to fire someone
because they have brought a wage claim before the labor commission. It's
illegal to fire an employee for disclosing his wages to a fellow employee. You
cannot be fired for reporting to state or federal authorities any illegalities
that you plausibly believe are occuring at your employer. For example, if you
think your employer is violating environmental laws by dumping petroleum
products into sewers instead of disposing of them in a proper manner and your
employer fired you for blowing the whistle on them, that would be unlawful. If
you are fired because you attempt to organize a union, that is unlawful under
the National Labor Relations Act. If you are fired by the company to try and
deprive you of your pension, that is prohibited under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act. Finally, if you are fired because you performed jury
service when summoned, that is unlawful.
</P>
<P>
Q. What if you were simply fired without warning or good cause?
</P>
<P>
A. The category most people fall under is that involving an expressed or
implied employment contract which limits the employer's right to terminate. For
instance, if an employer has a progressive discipline policy requiring warnings
or other procedures prior to termination but does not follow that, an employee
can bring a contract-based action for improper termination.
</P>
<P>
Q. How can an employee find out whether his or her company has such a policy?
</P>
<P>
A. Many employers issue employee handbooks which would contain such a policy.
And if you're a supervisor you have probably received instruction from your
employer as to the discipline of employees. If a policy is not in your employee
handbook, ask your supervisor or the personnel department.
</P>
<P>
Q. Besides what's contained in the employee handbook, are there other things a
company does that imply a contractual relationship?
</P>
<P>
A. Aside from written policy there is also the issue of actual practice. Even
if there is not a piece of paper that says a company will follow progressive
discipline but the way the employer disciplines employees amounts to a practice
of progressive discipline, then employees are entitled to be treated in the
same manner. There is an aspect of what's called the implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing which holds that like cases should be treated alike. For
example, if employees who are tardy or absent are normally cautioned at least
two times before being fired and a prospective client walks into my office and
says he was absent once and was fired for that absence and there had been no
other infractions committed by him, the employer would not be treating like
cases alike.
</P>
<P>
Q. What about performance appraisals?
</P>
<P>
A. Verbal and written communications by superiors are important. For example,
if your boss told you that you had a bright future with the company and you
bypass opportunities elsewhere, that would strengthen the claim for you based
on an implied contract. Make sure performance appraisals are done because they
will document whether you are or are not doing a good job and that is another
factor looked at in implied contract cases. If you have a series of favorable
evaluations and then all of a sudden you are told your performance warrants
termination, that is not going to carry the day unless they can show some very
specific misdeeds on the employee's part. The handbook, appraisals and length
of service are all building blocks of an implied contract.
</P>
<P>
Q. Should an employee ask to see his personnel file if he smells trouble?
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. Every employee in California has a statutory right to inspect his
personnel file and ought to exercise that right so the employee knows whether
he or she has been written up. The employee should send a written response to
the head of the personnel department and ask that a copy be placed in his
personnel file while the incident is fresh in his mind and he has an
opportunity to clear it up. Because employees come and go, it might be
important for the employee to speak to other employees at the time this occurs
because other employees' input may be critical to substantiating the employee's
version of the incident.
</P>
<P>
Q. Are there some firings that cannot be challenged in court?
</P>
<P>
A. If an employee was truly what is called "at will," that employee can be let
go for no reason. Someone who is an at-will employee doesn't have a contract,
implied or expressed. The United States is very unusual in that regard among
Western nations. In Western Europe there typically must be some legitimate
basis for termination. Otherwise, employees can obtain some monetary
compensation. But in California, if an employee is truly at will and doesn't
fall into any of the pigeonholes of the civil rights laws or specific statutory
prohibitions, he can be fired because the employer wakes up on the wrong side
of the bed.
</P>
<P>
Q. Are at-will firings common?
</P>
<P>
A. I screen out many more cases than I accept because the circumstance don't
seem to be such that the law will provide a remedy. There are many times when
people describe circumstances which strike me as unfair but they don't have any
legal recourse.
</P>
<P>
Q. How soon must a fired employee decide whether he will sue?
</P>
<P>
A. It's important for individuals to act in a timely manner because even if you
fall into a category where the law would permit relief, if you wait too long
you lose your rights. The time frames for each statute vary but an employee
should never let a full year lapse before proceeding against an employer.
Ideally, you should act more promptly than that, while witnesses are available
and recollections are fresh. Employment cases are almost always hard-fought.
And employers typically have much greater resources than individuals. The
typical plaintiff is by definition unemployed and suffering disastrous
financial consequences.
</P>
<P>
Q. Can an employee with a medical condition be fired?
</P>
<P>
A. When employees have been on a substantial medical leave because of a
non-work-related condition which does not amount to a physical handicap, they
can be fired. The man in the street feels it's grossly unfair, yet there is
nothing unlawful about it. Take somebody who was seriously injured but not
crippled in an automobile accident that wasn't work-related. The person is not
considered handicapped in the strictest sense of the law because they don't
have a permanent disabling condition. The employer might say you are fired
because it won't wait until you are ready to come back and the employee has no
recourse. The person may be entitled to state disability insurance but that
doesn't force the employer to retain the employee. Those two are not tied
together.
</P>
<P>
Q. How much is the fired employee going to have to spend on legal fees?
</P>
<P>
A. Typically employment attorneys, including me, handle cases on a contingency
basis. And that's another reason why it's important for plaintiff practitioners
to carefully evaluate cases. You can't make a living unless you win a fair
percentage of the time. If there is a valid claim, I'm willing not to bill the
client but take a contingency when and if we prevail.
</P>
<P>
Q. Is there anything an employee can do to make a wrongful termination case
airtight?
</P>
<P>
A. The best thing to do if you can is to have an expressed contract, and almost
the only time you will get that is when you are coming on board with a company
because that is the honeymoon period when an employer wants someone with a
specific skill or talent. Short of that, it's important for an employee to
document any agreement or promises that an employer makes. Take a sales
employee who is told verbally that if he reaches $150,000 in sales in a
specific time period he will receive an extra 10% bonus. If I were that
employee I would write a memo to that effect and send it to the person who sent
it to me -- "In accordance with our discussion if I reach X dollars in sales I
will be entitled to X percent extra commission." So as not to be too crass,
because tact is always important, the employee might do that in the text of a
memo about the extra sales efforts they intend to pursue to achieve the
company's goal.
</P>
<P>
Q. What kind of employees realistically could get such an agreement?
</P>
<P>
A. I think executives are the people who typically have an agreement of this
type.
</P>
<P>
Q. What should prospective employees look for in an employer?
</P>
<P>
A. Employees considering joining a company should ask the personnel department
to see a copy of the employee handbook and procedures. Carefully read what that
employer says in its official documents regarding how it's prepared to treat
its employees. Also, employees should be very wary of forms placed in front of
them which may vary from what they have been told are the terms of their
employment. For example, a manager recruiting an engineer from another
aerospace company may make all sorts of promises regarding bonuses, career
opportunities, et cetera, and yet the day they come on board they may have a
document placed in front of them saying something like, "I am aware no one has
authority to make any promises to me regarding length of employment and I can
be terminated at any time for any reason." Six or seven months later, that
employee is fired under circumstances which the employee believes to be
unlawful and, lo and behold, the management lawyer takes out Exhibit 1, this
preprinted form which says the employee can be fired any time for any reason
and says "Didn't you sign this," and "Of course you read it and understood it,
didn't you?" If you are asked to sign such a document, read it very carefully
and scratch out anything that contradicts what has been promised you.
</P>
<P>
Q. Should a fired employee accept severance pay if he is thinking of suing?
</P>
<P>
A. Employers do not have a legal obligation to pay severance. The fired
employee presented with a severance package needs to assess whether the money
being offered is worth accepting in exchange for giving up your potential
claims. The average employee would probably need to consult counsel to
determine whether they had a claim and its likely worth compared to the
severance package being offered.
</P>
<P>
Q. If your case does go to trial, how much can you win in damages?
</P>
<P>
A. That depends on the law the suit is based on. In an implied contract claim,
punitive damages -- those designed to punish and deter similar treatment in the
future -- are not available to you regardless of the outrageousness of the
employer's conduct. You can get all out-of-pocket losses -- lost wages and lost
benefits plus any catastrophic losses which flowed from the termination. For
example, an employee out of work might lose his home because he can't make the
mortgage payments. Emotional distress damages can also be pursued if such
distress foreseeably resulted from the termination. Under the Fair Employment
and Housing Act, you can get everything I just described plus punitive damages
and attorney's fees. So if a person was sexually harassed at work and brought a
claim under the FEHA, the remedies are potentially much greater than someone
whose contract was breached.

ORIGINAL T.S.O.L. BAND'S REUNION SHOW PACKS NOSTALGIA, LACKS FOCUS

<P>
Steve Soto, who knows a few things about Orange County punk rock, sat in the
upper rows of the Celebrity Theatre Friday night, surveying the house a few
minutes before the original members of T.S.O.L. were about to go on stage
together for the first time since 1983.
</P>
<P>
"This is our high school reunion," said Soto, who was co-founder of Agent
Orange and the Adolescents, two of the leading bands that came out of the
Orange County punk rock explosion of 1979-80. Then Soto said something else:
"There's money in punk-rock rehash."
</P>
<P>
That pretty much explained why the show was taking place. And the high school
reunion aspect had a lot to with why a near-capacity crowd (2,279 paid,
according to promoter Gary Tovar of Goldenvoice Presents) had turned out to see
it.
</P>
<P>
Other bands from the Orange County punk wave wrote songs that were better and
more melodic than the original T.S.O.L., and some groups had more staying
power. But T.S.O.L. (True Sounds of Liberty) built a reputation as the most
sensational, tempestuous and unpredictable live act of the local punk scene
during the early '80s.
</P>
<P>
The reunion brought out some younger fans who never had seen the band before --
like Christina Palmer, a 15-year-old from San Bernardino County who was
scrounging change outside the theater before the show to raise the price of a
ticket. She said that her interest in T.S.O.L. had been handed down from an
older generation of punkers, an aunt and uncle now in their 20s and 30s.
</P>
<P>
Robert Mora, a tall, hulking punk rock fan from Hollywood, said he used to go
see the original T.S.O.L. in Los Angeles when he was barely in his teens. Mora,
20, grumbled about how he could get in for as little as $1 to $5 in those days,
compared to the $20 he had paid to see T.S.O.L.'s reunion. "For all the money
they're getting, they'd better have a lot of energy," he said.
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, T.S.O.L. had enough energy to get by, but not enough focus or
group cohesiveness to infuse the show with much beyond nostalgia value.
</P>
<P>
Bassist Mike Roche (who came out wearing a top hat and red bandanna on his head
and a skull mask on his face) kept up a fast, rumbling pulse along with drummer
Todd Barnes, but the rhythm section only occasionally kicked the beat to a
surging peak.
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Ron Emory generated the most musical excitement of the bunch,
consistently churning out raw, slashing riffs and solos that often took on a
charged rockabilly edge reminiscent of Billy Zoom's work during the punk heyday
of X. Emory, now a member of Lunchbox, captured the roaring spirit of punk rock
with his one lead vocal of the night, spitting out convincing scorn for
authority during "Die for Me." Emory and lead singer Jack Grisham also raised
some effective punk ire with their call-and-response screams on one thrashing
number.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, that was the only truly interactive moment of the 50-minute
show. For the most part, Roche stayed in the background and Emory played in
self-contained, if intense, solitude at stage right, leaving Grisham to caper
about in his old role as T.S.O.L.'s ringleader and rabble rouser.
</P>
<P>
Grisham alluded to the fact that the band hadn't played together in seven
years, but there wasn't a flicker of warmth and sentiment between these old
cronies. No smiles exchanged, no pinball-style physical contact between players
(always helpful for a punk show), not even an introduction of the band members
or a mutual bow at the end.
</P>
<P>
The old personal animosities that split the band apart didn't surface, but the
four T.S.O.L. alumni appeared only to have contrived a truce for business
purposes, not a reconciliation born of rediscovered fondness for the good old
days and each other. Still, this aloofness was better and more true to the
take-us-as-we-are punk ethic than a feigned camaraderie would have been.
</P>
<P>
The concert wound up being mainly a vehicle for Grisham, the big, lithe,
naturally charismatic front man who spent the show moving about in graceful,
loping strides. Grisham, who now leads the hard rock band Tender Fury, doesn't
have an exceptionally rangy or powerful voice, but he hammed it up with the
theatrical, half-crooned, half-spoken vocals that distinguished T.S.O.L. from
its more snarling hard-core punk competitors.
</P>
<P>
The 15 or so songs that T.S.O.L. performed all were drawn from the two EPs and
two albums the original band released during its original run from 1980 to
1983. One of the early T.S.O.L.'s virtues was its willingness to experiment
with musical styles. The band changed with each recording, and that paid off in
its reunion by allowing for a variety of tone -- a rarity among punk rockers.
There were thrashing, politically oriented songs that railed at authority, the
lighter, more melodic approach of the reggae-inflected "Word Is," the
disgusting but funny necrophiliac fantasy of "Code Blue" and textured melodrama
on songs like "The Triangle," with its spy story full of paranoia, and the
stormily romantic "Wash Away." Most of the songs came off as grist for
Grisham's performance, rather than as deeply felt expression in which the song
itself mattered more than the singer.
</P>
<P>
Grisham has said he got into punk rock as a teen-ager because he saw it as an
outlet for his adolescent delight in all-purpose hell-raising. His instigator's
streak surfaced at the Celebrity, as he egged on an already tumultuous crowd to
leap over a wooden barrier and on to the stage. The many who tried didn't fare
very well: a cordon of linebacker-size security men would grasp each would-be
stage crasher in a bear hug and hustle the intruder out of the auditorium. But
if the aim of singer and audience was to recreate the tumult of the good old
days of punk, they pretty much succeeded.
</P>
<P>
(Whether out of savvy, instinct, or blind luck, Grisham picked just the right
moment to stall the show and let emotions subside at the point when the
turbulence in front of the stage threatened to get out of hand. He did so by
taking off his shoes and promising to perform naked. But Grisham, stripped to
the waist through most of the show, managed to keep his leather tights and
codpiece in place for the remainder of the concert).
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise of the show was Grisham's announcement from the stage that
what was to have been a one-time reunion will have a sequel Tuesday night at
Raji's nightclub in Hollywood. That show will be recorded for a live album
(Peter Heur, president of Triple X Records, said the second show was arranged
to avoid a $2,500 fee that the Celebrity Theatre required to record Friday
night's concert).
</P>
<P>
The decision to do a live album, which Heur said will be a joint release by
Triple X and Enigma Records, will have consequences for Mike Roche. Until now,
Roche had been the last original member of T.S.O.L. still playing with the
second-generation version of T.S.O.L., which has continued to tour and record
since 1984 while phasing out punk music in favor of a blues-rock and
heavy-metal slant. Roche's partners in the current T.S.O.L., Joe Wood and Mitch
Dean, had consented to his playing Friday's reunion only after much internal
haggling that threatened to split the band. The current members said they
aren't going to stand for Roche taking part in a reunion album as well, and
Roche said in a post-show interview that he is being ousted from T.S.O.L. as a
result.
</P>
<P>
"They said if I do this record I'm out of the band," Roche said. "I'm doing the
show (at Raji's). If it is so bitter and they want to replace me, I don't want
to play with them any more. We can't keep riding the merry-go-round." Roche
said he is considering legal action either to prevent Wood and Dean from
continuing to use the name T.S.O.L., or to gain financial compensation for use
of the name he says he originated.
</P>
<P>
Wood confirmed Saturday that the current T.S.O.L. was planning to perform
Saturday night in Montclair with a new bass player, Dave Mello. "I have the
ideal band. I'm happy," Wood said, dismissing the notion that Roche has more
claim to the T.S.O.L. name than he and Dean.
</P>
<P>
Wood has maintained that Roche's personal problems, more than the tension over
the original T.S.O.L.'s reunion, have undermined Roche's position in the band.
"If Mike gets his (stuff) together, he's welcome back (in the current
T.S.O.L.). He needs to get his priorities lined up."

EARLY EXHIBITS TO DISPLAY CONTEMPORARY LOOK
</P>

<P>
Well, out with the old year, in with the new. What's coming up on the visual
arts scene in Orange County? Happily, some impressive-sounding shows -- nearly
all devoted to contemporary work -- are on tap for the first six months of
1990.
</P>
<P>
One important point to keep in mind: While it's great for our museums and
galleries to host fine shows organized elsewhere, an institution's real
prestige comes from having done the planning, thinking and legwork on its own.
</P>
<P>
Newport's first big blast for the year opens April 8. "OBJECTives: THE NEW
SCULPTURE," (through June 24) is chief curator Paul Schimmel's last project
before he leaves for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. The show
presents a type of work by younger American and European artists that has come
to dominate the offerings of a number of major galleries in L.A., New York and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Called "Neo-Geo" or "Simulationism" in the United States, this work is about
our attitudes toward everyday objects and the way they reflect assumptions held
by the society that produced them.
</P>
<P>
Without knowing these works were created by artists and meant to carry a
particular set of meanings, viewers are likely to see such pieces merely as
mass-produced kitsch, a bizarre kind of window dressing or the whims of an
eccentric collector.
</P>
<P>
Clearly, work such as this cries out for explication -- a task that a museum
survey is equipped to undertake. Artists in the show include the much-lauded,
much-derided Jeff Koons as well as Grenville Davey, Katharina Fritsch, Annette
Lemieux, Julian Opie, Haim Steinbach and Robert Gober. Financial support comes
from the Irvine Co. and the National Endowment for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
Associate curator Lucinda Barnes' first show at Newport Harbor is also the
first one-person exhibition of Buzz Spector's art in California (Jan. 21
through March 18). An art critic and former book designer, Spector transforms
books "from object(s) of communication into . . . object(s) of the
imagination," as a Museum of Modern Art curator has written. Part of the
ongoing New California Artist series, the exhibit -- supported by the museum's
Century Club -- presents several of the artist's "altered books" (created by
tearing or carving) and one of his sculptural installations, made with 6,500
stacked volumes.
</P>
<P>
Although an exhibit called "Selections from the Permanent Collection" (Jan. 21
through March 18) sounds like old news, Newport's includes some significant
recent additions. One is "Rondo," an installation by celebrated "light and
space" artist James Turrell, purchased with funds from the Peter Norton Family
Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Art Museum's big contender -- the pet project of director Charles
Desmarais -- is "The Profound in the Banal: The Art of Ilene Segalove" (April
27 through July 8). The Los Angeles artist is well known for her deadpan
videotapes exploring the amazing-but-true blend of blandness and weirdness
experienced by middle-class suburbanite living in a consumer culture.
</P>
<P>
The show -- funded in part by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts
-- will include 30 large-scale photographic works, 12 videotapes and 20 audio
works. (Viewers may already have heard some of Segalove's audio pieces on
National Public Radio's "All Things Considered" and "Morning Edition.")
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Art Museum's South Coast Plaza Satellite site starts the new year
with a group of installations by San Francisco artist Paul Kos (Jan. 11 through
April 15). His new piece, "Ber lin" -- the title is divided to represent the
Berlin Wall -- incorporates neon, lights, two-by-fours and cuckoo clocks as
metaphors for recent political upheaval in the East Bloc.
</P>
<P>
Kos' other work in the show includes a couple of recent pieces -- "Silenced
Tongues" and "Trotsky" -- as well as "rEVOLUTION: Notes for the Invasion -- mar
mar march" from 1973, in which the rat-a-tat-tat of a typewriter stuttering
over the same word creates a hypnotic, marchlike cadence.
</P>
<P>
How brave of South Coast Plaza, which is bearing some of the costs of the show,
to have opened its pocketbook for such subversive-sounding stuff.
</P>
<P>
Other exhibits are imports from points east and north.
</P>
<P>
"Success Is a Job in New York ... The Early Art and Business of Andy Warhol"
runs from Jan 21 through March 18 at Newport Harbor, where is also is funded by
South Coast Plaza. Organized by the Grey Art Gallery and Study Center at New
York University, the show traces the artist's early commercial and
non-commercial art, before he became a big shot in the Pop world.
</P>
<P>
In 1959 Warhol came to New York from Pittsburgh, a 21-year-old with a design
degree from Carnegie Tech. His early jobs were with ad agencies, fashion
magazines and department stores. (The show's title comes from a magazine
article Warhol illustrated.) A few years later he was hired to design book
jackets and record albums, and he dabbled in "image shaping" for retail stores.
</P>
<P>
Only in 1957 did he give up commercial stints to focus on his own art -- which
was, of course, derived from the look of advertisements and throwaway media
imagery.
</P>
<P>
"Jay DeFeo: Works on Paper 1951-1989," which runs July 13 through Oct. 7 at the
main location of the Laguna Art Museum, was organized by the University Art
Museum, Berkeley. DeFeo, who died in November at 60, showed at the Ferus
Gallery in Los Angeles and was included in the prestigious "Sixteen Americans"
show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1959. One of the few women
painters of her era to hold her own with the big boys of the art world, she
worked in both figurative and abstract modes.
</P>
<P>
This exhibit -- funded by the Exhibitionists, a Laguna Art Museum council --
includes drawings, photo collages and paintings on paper.
</P>
<P>
For the die-hard lovers of California Impressionism, Laguna is trotting out
"Colors and Impressions: The Early Work of E. Charlton Fortune" on Feb. 2
(through April 15). Fortune was one of the handful of women (the "E" stood for
Euphemia) among the painters who introduced the French style so belatedly to
California in the 'teens of this century. Originated by the Monterey Peninsula
Museum of Art, the exhibit is supported in Laguna Beach by
Wittenberg/Livingston Inc.
</P>
<P>
The non-commercial galleries also have come up with a bunch of shows that sound
well worth checking out:
</P>
<P>
"John Paul Jones: The Man in the Mirror: The Constant Image" opens Jan. 9 at
the Art Institute of Southern California in Laguna Beach (through Feb. 20).
Phyllis Lutjeans, guest curator for the show, says it is not a real
retrospective; instead, as she modestly says, it's based on "a funky idea I
had." The exhibit includes about 40 works made by the UC Irvine art faculty
member from 1948 to 1989. Lutjeans believes the somewhat murky, amorphous
figurative images in Jones' early paintings and works on paper are strongly
related to the sculptures he has been making recently, in which viewers can see
reflections of themselves.
</P>
<P>
The redoubtably titled "California Collectors and Collections II: The Arts and
Crafts Movement in California 1900-1918: Traditions and Antecedents" opens Feb.
6 and runs through May 26 at the Center for the Study of Decorative Arts in San
Juan Capistrano. This movement -- led by English poet-artist-craftsman William
Morris -- was a revolt against the lack of quality and overdone embellishment
in machine-made Victorian furnishings. As Morris once said: "Have nothing in
your houses that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful."
</P>
<P>
In California, the Arts and Crafts spirit involved the use of restrained
designs and lavish use of natural woods, metals and minerals. It was kept alive
by such true believers as Greene &amp; Greene, the Pasadena architecture firm;
furniture maker Gustav Stickley; and Dirk van Erp, a San Francisco lamp maker.
Their influences will be visible in this exhibit of furniture, ceramics,
metalwork, lamps and textiles, including period rooms.
</P>
<P>
Only sparse information was available last week about upcoming offerings at
Saddleback College Art Gallery in Mission Viejo, but they include "Leningrad
Artists," Feb. 8 through March 9, recent work by painters who broke away from
the officially sanctioned styles and subjects of art in the U.S.S.R. The
exhibit is curated by Selma Holo of the Fischer Gallery at the University of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
Coming up Jan. 7 (through Feb. 10) at the UC Irvine Fine Arts Gallery is "The
Pleasure and the Terror: An Exhibition of Landscapes," works by Los Angeles
artists Richard Sedivy and Lynn Aldrich. He does mixed-media constructions on
canvas; her works are free-standing painted sculptures.
</P>
<P>
Sedivy is a popular guy in these parts: His paintings also can be seen in
"Insistent Landscapes" at Security Pacific Gallery in Costa Mesa. Opening Feb.
3 (through April 1), the exhibit includes paintings by Lawrence Gipe (whose
work was at the Laguna museum a couple of years ago), Tobi Kahn, Marcia Cygli
King, Vicki Teague-Cooper and Jean Towgood. For that matter, work by Annette
Lemieux (shown concurrently in Newport Harbor's "OBJECTives") makes another
appearance in a Security Pacific show provisionally called "Representational
and Non-Representational Strategies" (April 21 to June 3), along with Moira
Dryer, David French, Jim Iserman, Ronald Jones, Lari Pittman, Rosemarie Trockel
and Sohki Wagner. Meanwhile, the gallery's Project Room gets a mysterious new
tenant: an installation by Los Angeles artist Michael McMillen called "Train of
Thought" (Feb. 3 through July 29).
</P>
<P>
Art, architecture and music are the topics of several hot-ticket lectures and
lecture series this winter and spring at the museums.
</P>
<P>
Francoise Gilot, an artist who was Pablo Picasso's mistress in the late '40s
and early '50s speaks on "Cocteau as I Knew Him 1944-1963" at the Severin
Wunderman Museum in Irvine on Jan. 20 at 4 p.m. Picasso introduced Gilot to
author and artist Jean Cocteau, and they remained friends until his death in
1963. The museum is at 3 Mason St. Ticket prices are $20 general, $12 seniors
and students with ID. For more information and reservations, call (714)
472-1138.
</P>
<P>
"California and Beyond: The State of Design in the '90s," a five-part lecture
series, begins Feb. 7 at Beckman Center on the UC Irvine campus. Sponsored by
Newport Harbor Art Museum, the series includes talks by architect Michael
Graves (Feb. 7), landscape architect George Hargreaves (Feb. 28), architect
Steven Holl (March 14), graphic designer April Grieman (March 28) and architect
Frank Israel (April 11).
</P>
<P>
Supported by The Western Regional Philanthropic Committee of Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. and the Shearson Lehman Hutton Mortgage Corp., the series is a
project of the Forum, the museum's architecture and design council. Tickets are
$75 for the entire series. (Mail checks no later than Feb. 1 to the Newport
Harbor Education Dept., 850 San Clemente Drive, Newport Beach, 92660).
Single-lecture tickets will be sold at the door only ($15). All lectures start
at 7:30 p.m. For more information, call (714) 759-1122.
</P>

THE MARSHAL OF CONTROVERSY;
</P>
<P>
TOUCHED BY A SCANDAL, SEN. JOHN GLENN WILL STILL BE AN ASTRONAUT-HERO TO MANY
WHEN LEADING TOURNAMENT OF ROSES PARADE

<P>
It has been a bit of a sticky wicket, conceded Tournament of Roses president
Don Fedde -- "We don't like controversy more than anybody else. Let's put it
that way."
</P>
<P>
But here was Fedde, a genial 52-year-old furniture store owner who has served
the tournament faithfully for 25 years, finally getting his shot at the top job
and with it the honor of choosing the grand marshal for today's Rose Parade.
</P>
<P>
And, bingo, controversy.
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 12, with flair and flourishes, former astronaut John H. Glenn, now a U.
S. senator from Ohio, was announced as grand marshal for today's 101st
Tournament of Roses parade. Announcing his choice, Fedde had praised Glenn as
"a hero with steely nerves and harmonious hometown values. . . . "
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 13, in what Fedde understatedly describes as an "unfortunate" bit of
timing, the Common Cause citizens' lobby called for investigations of five
senators, including Glenn and California's Alan Cranston, on charges they
improperly interfered with a federal investigation of now-bankrupt Lincoln
Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine.
</P>
<P>
The Senate Ethics Committee announced 2 1/2 weeks ago that it was beginning a
preliminary investigation to determine whether the five had abused their
office.
</P>
<P>
Glenn's integrity, heretofore untarnished, is being questioned, the key issue
being whether Lincoln owner Charles Keating bought Glenn's influence with a
$200,000 contribution to a political action committee controlled by the Ohio
senator.
</P>
<P>
"On selection day, we had thought it was the greatest (pick) we could have
made," Fedde said, adding that Glenn had been a noncontroversial choice for
grand marshal, a standout among the dozen or so finalists that included
musicians, actors -- and former Presidents.
</P>
<P>
Now, the committee was left to wonder if its hero might have feet of clay.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that there was never any serious thought given to uninviting
Glenn. "We couldn't find any basis," he said. "There's nothing but innuendo.
The innuendo has been very heavy, admittedly. But we think we know all the
facts."
</P>
<P>
As the "Keating 5" scandal grew, Fedde made it his business to learn everything
he could about it. "I read every article, taped every program," he said.
</P>
<P>
From Washington, Fedde obtained a copy of the transcript of the meeting that
took place in April, 1987, with the five senators and federal thrift
regulators, a meeting called at the urging of Charles Keating.
</P>
<P>
From Glenn, he got a copy of an eight-page statement the senator wrote around
Thanksgiving, explaining what he did and did not do, and concluding: "My life
has been, and remains, an open book. . . . It's been a life based on decency,
honor, integrity and the highest ethical standards. I have not changed, and
with every fiber in my being, I resent anyone implying otherwise."
</P>
<P>
Never, Fedde said, was there one terrible moment of crisis when the
tournament's nine-man executive committee sat down and asked themselves, "What
do we do now?" It was more a matter of worrying about how big this thing was
going to get and how soon.
</P>
<P>
Although they continued to read about the savings and loan scandal and Glenn,
Fedde said, "We have looked into it deeply and we feel his conscience is clear,
and we think time will prove our decision to be the right one to proceed with
him. . . . He is a national hero and we still consider him so. . . . We just
want to honor a space pioneer."
</P>
<P>
Sure, some may be critical of the tournament's choice for grand marshal, Fedde
shrugged. Last year, the honor went to Shirley Temple Black, hardly a wildly
controversial figure, and, he said, "We even got letters on her."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Glenn, for his part, appeared to be enjoying himself enormously as
he dutifully worked his way through three days of formalities leading up to the
parade.
</P>
<P>
In an interview Friday morning, shortly after returning from a jog, he said he
wasn't worried about the Keating scandal -- "Not at all. That'll all come out
all right. I'm not concerned." Everything will be OK, he added, when "what I
did not do comes out."
</P>
<P>
Had he at any time considered withdrawing as grand marshal? "No, not at all. I
had no reason to step down. . . . If people have been misled by the media,
well, I'm sorry about that. But I know the American people to be very fair."
</P>
<P>
For the long haul, Glenn said, he is not concerned. In the short run, he
acknowledged, his implication in the Keating affair, is "very irritating."
</P>
<P>
As for the Rose Parade and Rose Bowl game, "We've watched every year on TV," he
said. "Of course, I'd hoped maybe Ohio State (not Michigan) might be here. I
guess we're character-building this year."
</P>
<P>
The entire Glenn family will be on hand. Annie, his wife, will ride with him.
In the stands will be their son, Dr. David Glenn, an anesthesiologist in San
Francisco, his wife, Karen, and their sons, Daniel, 7, and Zachary, 5, as well
as the Glenns' daughter, Lyn, who lives in St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
Glenn hopes to get some good film along the route with his new hand-held
camcorder.
</P>
<P>
There is no indication that he intends to let the cloud of scandal rain on his
parade.
</P>
<P>
"We're looking forward to it," he said. "I'm really getting a big kick out of
it. It's a great honor."
</P>
<P>
At his first official appearance as grand marshal, at the annual Kiwanis
kickoff luncheon Friday at The Pasadena Center, the reception Glenn received
indicated that, in the eyes of the public, he is still the bona fide hero who
became the first American to orbit the globe in the little Friendship 7
capsule, one February morning 28 years ago.
</P>
<P>
As he was introduced by Fedde as "the perfect person" to lead this year's
parade, Glenn -- the World War II bomber pilot, Korean War fighter pilot and a
test pilot who once set a transcontinental speed record -- received a steady
round of applause, building to a crescendo, then to a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
He responsed with a patriotic pep talk, in which he spoke of "walls tumbling
down" and "dictators tumbling down" throughout Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
A fit and youthful-looking 68, Glenn, who became a multimillionaire through
investments in hotels and who briefly was a Democratic Presidential candidate,
breezed through a Saturday morning of television interviews at Tournament House
in Pasadena. He described for one interviewer how weightlessness in space
feels, talked about the California sunshine and the bitter cold back home in
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
Fedde seemed well pleased. Everything seemed harmonious, nicely in keeping with
this year's parade theme, "A World of Harmony."
</P>
<P>
That theme had proved to be an inspired choice this particular year, although,
Fedde acknowledged, "What we had in mind was the wonderful Reagan-Gorbachev
relationship. How were we to know about these incredible world events?"
</P>
<P>
Still, the accolades for omniscience were music to his ears in a year when
tournament-bashing appeared to be in vogue. Although there have been reports
that parade and game tickets were all but going begging, not so, Fedde said.
Sales, he said, were only "minutely off."
</P>
<P>
And there were the critics asking, once again, if it is moral to spend hundreds
of thousands of dollars to build pretty floats when there are thousands of
people hungry and homeless.
</P>
<P>
"There's always an anti-Establishment element," Fedde said, observing that the
festivities are more than "just a party," that $10 million in television
revenues are divided among the 20 Big 10 and Pac 10 schools.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he observed, "on a cost per impression basis, (a float) is one of the
best bargains in the world" for corporate America. It's advertising, PR, so
"why not say it in a joyous, beautiful way?"
</P>
<P>
He was more concerned about glitches that could arise, even after 18 months of
planning. What was going to happen to the people who traditionally park on the
other side of the arroyo and walk over Colorado Bridge? The bridge has been
closed as unsafe but, he knows, "they're not going to be aware of it until New
Year's morning."
</P>
<P>
A giant robot, the parade entry from General Motors-United Auto Workers, had
been a potential troublemaker, 40 feet wide (that's 22 feet over what's
allowed). The committee worked that one out. Said Fedde, "We've put the arms on
separate circuits so one arm can go down when the other one comes up."
</P>
<P>
The committee, he said, had been very, very busy dealing with requests for
exceptions to size limits: "We don't want the parade to be a size race, a
budget race or a horsepower race."
</P>
<P>
Fedde had just received a memo from one of his staff with the information that
the lead car in this year's parade, a 1952 Chrysler Imperial Phaeton limousine,
was the very car that appeared in the 1984 film, "The Right Stuff," carrying
actor Ed Harris as astronaut Glenn in the tumultuous New York ticker tape
parade in his honor in 1962.
</P>
<P>
(Glenn greeted this news with his opinion that the whole film should have been
left on the cutting room floor).
</P>
<P>
It was all about to happen. Horses, parades, floats.
</P>
<P>
And an embattled American hero as grand marshal.
</P>
<P>
Fedde emphasized that all of his opinions on the Glenn matter were just that,
his opinions, adding, "Nothing in this world is absolutely certain. We're
running on faith, and that's all you can do."

ERA ENDS AS JONES EXITS TOP POST AT NORTHROP CORP.;
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: IN HIS 30 YEARS AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE HE LED THE COMPANY FROM RELATIVE
OBSCURITY TO A PLACE AS A MAJOR MILITARY PRIME CONTRACTOR.
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The last of the aerospace industry Titans, the men who became synonymous with
their corporations and the aircraft they produced, is gone with the departure
of Thomas V. Jones as chief executive of Northrop Corp.
</P>
<P>
Jones, who at Northrop's helm for 30 years came to personify the maverick
aerospace company and who survived an astonishing succession of personal
controversies, will remain its chairman but will retire today as an employee of
the company.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the aerospace industry has rushed to give Jones several major
awards for his career accomplishments, adding to the long list of recognitions
that he has received as an aviation leader. The City of Hawthorne even named a
park for him.
</P>
<P>
But Jones is stepping down from his post with the company still under
indictment on criminal charges and facing several investigations by federal
grand juries in Los Angeles and elsewhere. And although he undoubtedly built
Northrop into a leading prime contractor, the success of his legacy depends on
the outcome of several risky programs.
</P>
<P>
"They don't make them like Jones anymore," said Paine Webber aerospace analyst
Joseph Campbell. "Jones is the last of the old guard. It is the passing of an
era -- rightfully so."
</P>
<P>
Jones declined to be interviewed for this story. A Northrop spokesman said
Jones was so busy that he had no time to talk.
</P>
<P>
Jones came from a time when aerospace chiefs made gutsy big gambles on new
technology, and Jones made some of the biggest wagers in history. He bet $1.2
billion of shareholder money on the F-20 jet fighter during the 1980s and
failed to sell one. But he also gambled big on the B-2 Stealth bomber program
and turned the industry on its ear by winning.
</P>
<P>
In the process, he transformed a relatively small and flagging aerospace
company in the late 1950s into one of the major military prime contractors in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
"He took Northrop to a commanding position, at least technologically and in the
engineering systems to exploit that technology," said Prudential-Bache analyst
Paul Nisbet. "He has been a strong factor in bringing the company to where it
is, though there is divided opinion over exactly where that is."
</P>
<P>
Jones is leaving with the company deeply in debt and with a market value of
just $823 million, less than what two of his Stealth bombers cost. Northrop is
teetering on the edge of tremendous success or virtual extinction, depending on
the outcome of the B-2 and the advanced tactical fighter, or ATF, programs.
</P>
<P>
However those programs fare, Jones was a driving force behind the development
of the F-5 jet fighter, the T-38 Air Force trainer and the Navy YF-17, which
became the basis for the current F-18 jet fighter.
</P>
<P>
"He should be remembered as an enormously effective pioneer of new airplanes,"
said Thomas O. Paine, a former Northrop president. "He has an incredibly
powerful personal determination to succeed against all odds."
</P>
<P>
But Jones had another side to his personality -- a penchant for bold acts that
often carried an unnecessary risk, according to another former colleague.
</P>
<P>
"Jones brings to mind that statement from Adm. Arleigh Burke: 'Give me a strong
ship, for I intend to sail into harm's way.' Well, Tom liked to sail into
harm's way," the former colleague said.
</P>
<P>
"Tom gets a big kick out of getting into trouble and then getting out," he
added. "It is ingrained in his personality."
</P>
<P>
Jones got into more trouble and survived more often than probably any
contemporary aerospace executive.
</P>
<P>
In 1975, Jones signed a consent agreement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in which he promised not to bribe any foreign officials. That was
after the company had allegedly paid out $30 million to foreign officials in
connection with international arms deals.
</P>
<P>
Northrop, under Jones, became the consummate international arms merchant,
selling its F-5 jet fighter to nations from Norway to Saudi Arabia. Jones
became close to the Shah of Iran and at one time proudly displayed a Persian
rug at the company headquarters that was a gift from the Shah.
</P>
<P>
Jones also pleaded guilty to a federal felony count during the Watergate
scandal in which he admitted to falsifying documents involving political
contributions that were linked to a Richard Nixon slush fund.
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath, Jones agreed to form a board of directors that was
constituted almost entirely of outsiders. But that board eventually became a
source of support for him, backing such risky Jones ventures as the F-20, ATF
and B-2.
</P>
<P>
"There isn't much more you can accomplish," said William Ballhaus, a board
member who has known Jones throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
Robert L. J. Long, another board member, said Jones "made some significant
contributions to the whole aerospace industry."
</P>
<P>
But Ballhaus and Long sought to dispel any doubt that Kent Kresa, the president
and new chief executive, is in full control of the company.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Jones' precise role will be determined by (Kresa)," Long said.
</P>
<P>
Ballhaus said: "It is a transition from the Jones era and it will now be the
Kresa era. As a non-employee, Jones is free to go sail a boat. I am sure he
will not be there (at his office) every day."
</P>
<P>
The Kresa era will also begin with a substantially new slate of top executives.
Since the start of 1989, eight of Northrop's 22 elected corporate officers,
many of whom were Jones cronies, have left. Most recently, Northrop general
counsel William M. Elliott quietly departed the company at a time of legal
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The company is facing probes by federal grand juries in Texas, Hawaii and
California. One inquiry is into whether $7.75 million in payments to Koreans
violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The company was also indicted
on federal charges of criminal fraud earlier this year in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Despite all these problems, Jones' departure was not forced on him, according
to knowledgeable sources.
</P>
<P>
A former Northrop executive said: "It was a situation where Jones himself
recognized it was time to leave. There were people in Washington, in the Air
Force and at the Pentagon, who let it be known that they would not be unhappy
if he retired."

<P>
MERCENARIES: MIKE HARARI ONCE WORKED FOR MOSSAD. BUT HE BECAME THE PANAMA
STRONGMAN'S RIGHT-HAND MAN.

<P>
JERUSALEM
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The news proved false, but a report last week that Mike Harari, an Israeli
mercenary and right-hand man to deposed Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega,
was under arrest caused brief anxiety among government officials here.
</P>
<P>
Harari is a former agent in the Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, who
gained prominence as a figure in business and arms dealings between Israel and
Panama, of which he was reported to take hefty commissions. Harari also trained
anti-terrorist and private security squads for Noriega.
</P>
<P>
Israeli diplomats in Panama and American congressmen have warned Israel on
several occasions that if Noriega and Washington collided, Harari could prove
to be an embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
Before word arrived that U.S. troops had in fact not detained Harari, officials
here had already moved to disown him. Whatever he was doing, he was doing it on
his own, they insisted.
</P>
<P>
"He is a private citizen. As far as I know, he has no connection with the
government of Israel," said Yosef Amihud, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of Harari say that he is in Israel, Israel Radio reported last week.
It is not yet clear whether Harari would face charges in Panama if he were
captured.
</P>
<P>
Harari, 62, is the second prominent Israeli whose tangled relationships with
suspected Latin American drug dealers made Israel blush last year. Officials in
Colombia accused Yair Klein, a retired army colonel, of training killers on
behalf of cocaine smugglers. Klein said he was training cattle ranchers to
defend themselves against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The Harari and Klein cases had another common thread: Both men evidently traded
on skills that have limited marketability in their home country, once their
official services ended. There are more than 800 Israeli companies that export
anti-terrorist, paramilitary and security training overseas; most are manned by
former soldiers and intelligence agents.
</P>
<P>
Harari's long career with the Mossad included some of the agency's most deadly
missions. He headed a force of "hit squads" to kill Palestinian terrorists in
Europe. Harari's Mossad career seemed at an end when, in the mid-1970s, one of
the hit squads mistook a Moroccan waiter in Norway for an Arab terrorist and
shot him dead.
</P>
<P>
Harari also served as Mossad chief for Mexico and Central America before
retiring in the late 1970s. After leaving the Mossad, Harari managed a large
insurance firm for a while, published reports here said.
</P>
<P>
As early as 1983, Harari was reported to be selling arms to Panama. An Israeli
partnership that included Harari won a contract to harvest lumber in Panama,
and he was a middleman in deals that led to Israeli participation in public
works and telephone projects in Panama.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Harari appeared in Jerusalem with credentials from the Panamanian
government appointing him honorary consul in Israel, and he headed Panama's
commercial mission here. That same year, he was photographed -- wearing his
trademark aviator sunglasses -- escorting Panama's civilian president at that
time, Eric A. Delvalle, around Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli newspapers reported that businessmen here resented Harari because they
said he demanded participation in any dealings with Panama. "Mister 60%," his
detractors called him. In 1988, Jose Blandon, Noriega's former consul in New
York, told U.S. congressional investigators that Harari managed arms-smuggling
operations for Noriega.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Israeli newspapers reported that Washington asked Israel to
recall Harari from Panama, but Jerusalem responded that it had no control over
him. But intelligence observers point out that it is rare for former Mossad
officials to completely sever their links with the intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
"It would strain relations with the U.S. if someone working for Israel was also
undermining the Americans in a place like Panama," said one observer.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The man who runs Panama has an office in the Presidential Palace and roars
through town in a bulletproof limousine accompanied by armored cars full of
large, heavily armed bodyguards who wear ominous dark glasses.
</P>
<P>
He decides who can walk free and who goes to jail, when citizens can be on the
street and when they have to be in their houses, and even what avenues are open
to traffic.
</P>
<P>
This man is not President Guillermo Endara, nor is he the popular, charismatic
2nd Vice President Guillermo (Billy) Ford, nor the intellectual 1st Vice
President Ricardo Arias Calderon. He isn't even a Panamanian.
</P>
<P>
And if you thought, well, it must be the American ambassador, you would be
wrong. The man who runs Panama is a middle-aged career diplomat who has never
reached the rank of ambassador -- in fact, he's never held a post higher than
that of the No. 2 diplomat in the American Embassy in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
He is a tall, stooped American with thinning hair and a desire not to be
identified in public. His name is John Bushnell -- and he is the closest thing
the United States has to a proconsul.
</P>
<P>
While Endara, a once-obscure lawyer with no political following, is enjoying
the public trappings of office -- a Mercedes-Benz limousine, a tricolored
presidential sash and bowing and scraping aides, Bushnell wears a simple, white
sport shirt and nondescript slacks.
</P>
<P>
The only things that set him apart from the crowd are his security guards and a
white bulletproof vest that he wears outside his shirt.
</P>
<P>
But, when the new Panamanian government was temporarily located in the Foreign
Ministry, the two vice presidents had their offices in cramped quarters on the
first floor -- while Bushnell was ensconced next to Endara in comfortable rooms
on the second floor. He even lives in the same building where Endara, Ford and
Arias live near the American Embassy.
</P>
<P>
If Bushnell appears unassuming and his title is nothing more than U.S. deputy
chief of mission, the people in the know here know who to talk to when things
need to be done.
</P>
<P>
When U.S. troops stepped over the bounds of international law and violated the
diplomatic sanctity of the Nicaraguan ambassador by raiding his official
residence, it was Bushnell who was called and who fixed things.
</P>
<P>
And when American troops were trying to unnerve ousted dictator Manuel A.
Noriega by playing loud rock music outside his hiding place in the Vatican
embassy, it was Bushnell who ordered the broadcasts toned down after the
Vatican's emissary complained that he couldn't sleep.
</P>
<P>
Bushnell is reported to have approved sending American troops to seal the area
around the Peruvian Embassy because of reports that Noriega might seek asylum
there, and he was the one the Peruvian ambassador complained to.
</P>
<P>
"No diplomat calls (U.S.) Ambassador (Arthur) Davis; he doesn't count," said a
European envoy about Davis -- the almost invisible political appointee who is
mocked by some associates as Elmer Fudd because he has a slight speech
impediment.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Bushnell has signed off on curfew hours set for this capital
city and makes the final decisions on which former Noriega officials and
cronies are arrested. And, says a senior embassy official who asked not to be
identified, until the Panamanian government is capable of assuming police and
security functions, "the embassy is in operational control" of Panama.
</P>
<P>
That means, says a different official, John Bushnell.
</P>
<P>
Bushnell's role is not the only unusual aspect of life in Panama in the wake of
the Dec. 20 American invasion.
</P>
<P>
Part of that invasion has been a massive influx of reporters and broadcast
technicians. At one point, the figure reached nearly 500, many of whom had
never covered a military operation nor been near danger.
</P>
<P>
The number of journalists quickly overwhelmed the American military's capacity
to deal with them. To pare down the total to something manageable, the U.S.
Southern Command took an imaginative approach that showed more originality than
some of its battle tactics.
</P>
<P>
First, the military made life very uncomfortable -- preventing reporters from
leaving U.S. bases but not providing places to sleep, adequate facilities for
filing their dispatches or sufficient food.
</P>
<P>
Then, the soldiers turned to scare tactics. After describing how his car had
been shot at near the American Embassy and saying that "it is war out there,"
Col. Ronald Sconyers, the Southern Command's spokesman, said a charter flight
had been arranged to take anyone to Miami who wanted to go.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 125 of the 300 journalists in the room immediately signed on for the
trip, even though none had been outside of the American-run Howard Air Base
here or had been in Panama for more than 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
Even though Noriega has been thoroughly discredited -- and even the former
dictator's most loyal supporters now sport Endara T-shirts -- some signs of the
former regime remain.
</P>
<P>
Standing 20 feet tall on Via Espana, one of Panama City's busiest streets, is a
huge poster, unblemished by graffiti, pronouncing "Carlos Duque, President."
</P>
<P>
Duque was Noriega's handpicked presidential candidate who was embarrassingly
trounced in last May's vote. Noriega ultimately annulled the results. Duque is
being sought by the U.S. military.

CARING FOR THE EARTH
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Events converged during 1988 to make the state of the Earth a matter of keen
public concern. Now comes the difficult part. In 1989 the involved officials
must move forcefully to translate that concern into serious public policy so
that this new awareness does not become just another passing trend or lost
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
The issues will not go away. There is a danger, however, that the enormousness
of the collective problem will overwhelm a public desire to do something. After
all, what can one person do about the atmosphere or the ocean? The United
States has become a result-oriented nation that likes to see some bang for its
buck, and soon. A dollar invested today to avert a global-warming crisis may
have no visible payoff for decades.
</P>
<P>
But perception is critically important. What made 1988 the year of the Earth
may have been a coincidence of unrelated and largely irrelevant circumstances.
The appearance of medical waste on Atlantic beaches or the Yellowstone Park
fires had nothing to do with the ozone hole. The 1988 drought may have had
nothing to do with global warming. The growing trash crisis certainly did not.
But all these events impinged on the public consciousness until they set off an
alarm bell: Something is very wrong.
</P>
<P>
The importance of this public attention cannot be underrated. But little
happened in 1988 that was new or surprising to most environmental scientists.
And Earthlings possess most or all of the technical equipment needed to slow or
halt just about all the bad things that are assaulting the planet. What has
been lacking is the public demand, the political will and an institutional
structure for facing the challenge.
</P>
<P>
The new year provides the opportunity for setting this process in motion. The
obvious source of leadership is the presidency. President-elect George Bush
already has been inundated with stacks of studies for combatting environmental
problems on a national and global scale. One of the best was compiled by a
50-member bipartisan task force under the chairmanship of Sens. Timothy E.
Wirth (D-Colo.) and John Heinz III (R-Pa.). In addition to the more traditional
regulatory controls, the plan emphasizes the search for common ground and the
development of market incentives for pollution control.
</P>
<P>
The Wirth-Heinz outline also makes the critical point that the public must be
informed of the full social costs of environmental action or inaction, not just
the direct outlays. Because so many environmental issues are interrelated, some
policies will attack several problems at once and provide multiple benefits.
The energy-efficiency program advocated by the Wirth-Heinz study would help
fight global warming, acid rain and local air pollution while also improving
U.S. energy security and productivity. Short-term investments can yield
long-range national economic benefits. Existing fragmented federal policies
often work at cross-purposes or lack the public attention and support that they
deserve.
</P>
<P>
Bush will have to decide what he thinks are the most effective means of
advancing the environmental agenda. An address to Congress is an obvious
possibility. Or he could revive the dormant President's Council on
Environmental Quality, which is supposed to serve as a clearing house and as a
coordinator of programs. Better yet would be the creation of a Cabinet
Department of the Environment that would consolidate the Environmental
Protection Agency with related agencies from within the Interior and
Agriculture departments. Most other industrialized nations created
cabinet-level environmental agencies years ago.
</P>
<P>
Since so many of these issues observe no boundaries, the United States must
pursue international agreements to control pollutants and preserve critical
rain forests. The environment is an appropriate topic for the next superpower
summit and the annual meeting of the Western industrial nations, leading
perhaps to a global environmental conference.
</P>
<P>
Environmental problems, from protection of U.S. wild lands to the global
atmosphere, seem immense. Still, every citizen can have an effect. It begins
with caring.

JUDGE'S RULING IN BABY KILLING
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I was a medical student in Sacramento in the 1970s, I was a member of a
multidisciplinary team of professionals who worked hundreds of hours a year
attempting to help children who were battered, tortured, and mutilated by
people who unfortunately had the biological capability of bearing them.
</P>
<P>
One particularly disgusting example was a female who had killed one of her
children, severely tortured two others, and finally managed to kill a third,
who had been sent back into the home by a "compassionate" judge who felt that
the biological mother was more valuable than a foster one. This woman was
admitted to our hospital in Sacramento to bear another child.
</P>
<P>
Our child abuse team reacted quickly, obtaining a court order to take the
newborn child away. The woman sued, but quickly dropped the case, deciding to
move to Nevada and "have all the babies I want." I felt a profound sense of
nausea, sadness, and anger for weeks following that horrible case. The outcome
caused one of our social workers to resign -- she just couldn't handle these
situations anymore.
</P>
<P>
I felt the same sense of nausea, sadness, and anger when I read the article
regarding Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald's ruling in the case of Sheryl Lynn
Massip's battering and eventual murder of her infant son ("Judge Clears Mother
Who Killed Baby," Part I, Dec. 24).
</P>
<P>
From my previous reading about the case, there would appear little doubt that
the woman battered and killed her son. A jury of her peers came to this
conclusion after a long, and I am sure, emotionally difficult trial. There is
little doubt in my mind also that the woman was emotionally distraught when she
murdered her baby.
</P>
<P>
But criminally insane? A much more profound proposition! When I worked as a
family physician, I delivered hundreds of babies, and followed these kids and
their mothers through the early years of their lives. No murders. A few
distraught mothers who needed to talk out their frustrations, but no murders.
What happened with Sheryl Lynn Massip?
</P>
<P>
If Massip was criminally insane, why were the examining psychiatrists and her
jurors unable to realize this? In explaining his reasoning, Judge Fitzgerald
said, " . . . I didn't have any choice but to find her insane. . . . She was
bonkers." Well, judge, I think you had two other fairly obvious choices: First,
you could do your job as described by law; you could administer an appropriate
sentence based upon the verdict handed down by the jury. A murder conviction
demands a murder sentence.
</P>
<P>
Second, if you truly bought the concept that the defendant was insane on the
basis of postpartum depression, and was therefore totally out of control, you
could have acted to save the lives of her future babies by ordering that the
woman undergo sterilization. If she was truly insane as a result of her
postpartum hormonal imbalance, why should she be any less insane with her next
baby?

JUDGE'S RULING IN BABY KILLING

<P>
Since it seems quite likely that the Supreme Court will overturn or
significantly modify Roe vs. Wade, Judge Fitzgerald's decision to reject the
jury's guilty verdict in the Massip case is most timely.
</P>
<P>
Abortions will no longer be necessary, anyway, now that the mother can run over
the kid and plead "postpartum psychosis" (or "bonkers" to put it in the judge's
more technical language).

THE CAMPUS AND PUBLIC SERVICE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Increasing numbers of college students want to serve their communities. Some
help homeless people find shelter and services. Others tutor children or teach
the illiterate how to read. Now a coalition of more than 40 California colleges
and universities, public and private, has agreed to help these students to help
others. The California Compact, as it is called, plans to work with communities
to identify the problems on which students could work, try to win foundation
support for these volunteer programs, and get faculty members as well as
students involved. It's a gift of commitment that should not go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
The California Compact has just been launched as part of a national effort
called Campus Compact, which is sponsored by the Education Commission of the
States and has been in existence for several years. The California group is
co-chaired by Stanford University President Don Kennedy and UCLA Chancellor
Charles E. Young, and includes among others the University of Southern
California, Occidental College, Claremont McKenna College, Los Angeles City
College, the California State University system and the University of
California campuses. The James Irvine Foundation has just announced a $120,000
donation over the next three years to enable private universities to
participate in the compact.
</P>
<P>
It's just this kind of program that California legislators sought to foster
when they passed a bill sponsored by Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa
Clara). That measure encouraged students to work 30 hours a year in their
communities and urged their colleges to help them, in part by providing
academic credit for some of their work. The efforts have gotten under way
despite the governor's unwillingness to spend the $240,000 needed to help
organize the program.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the organization of the compact, UCLA's Chancellor Young said
recently that government resources may continue to be scarce, "but our human
resources are potentially unlimited." He said that the colleges want to help
build a "citizenry of problem solvers."
</P>
<P>
People who have studied college life have said for years that higher education
could be made more meaningful if it inculcated in young Americans the value of
public service. The California Compact aims to make that recommendation a
reality.

Andrea Rosenwein, in a Dec. 17 commentary ("L.A. Renters: Condemned to
Extinction?" Editorial Page), bemoaned circumstances that forced her to join
the "real word (of) exorbitant rents." However, this followed years of enjoying
artificially low housing costs. An acknowledgement that the law (rent control,
for example) can fix the price but not the cost of a commodity would have shown
more real world awareness.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is a mega-city beginning an explosive increase in population
density; spacious lodgings in a desirable neighborhood in such a city are not
easily had, particularly by those with low incomes. Most, like myself, wind up
east or south of her neck of the woods, in whatever midway between splendor and
squalor they can manage.
</P>
<P>
There are 5 billion people in the world. If Rosenwein stopped worrying
exclusively about developers and considered how many others would like to be
where she is, the cost of her desired life style would be more explicable.

'CLEANING UP THE BALLOT'
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was pleased to read in The Times Dec. 26 editorial "Cleaning Up the Ballot"
that you support initiative reform in California. The Times printed my
initiative reform proposal "Keep the Initiatives but Reinvolve Legislators" on
Nov. 27 (Op-Ed Page).
</P>
<P>
While the indirect initiative process proposed by the League of Women Voters
and supported by The Times sounds similar to my idea, there are some
differences. According to the editorial, the League's proposal would allow
initiative proponents to avoid the legislative process by requiring the
signature gatherers to meet a higher signature quota than if they submitted it
to review. This seems to me to subvert the very idea of indirect initiatives,
i.e., to involve the governor and the Legislature in the process.
</P>
<P>
My initiative reform solution would require the involvement of the governor and
Legislature on any ballot initiative for which at least half the required
signatures had been gathered. The governor would be required to appoint a
three-member commission to make recommendations to him within 60 days. The
Legislature would then have 90 days to deal with the governor's
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
We have had a plethora of initiatives lately because the governor and the
Legislature have failed to deal with pressing problems facing California
residents. My proposal would involve them in the process. That's what they are
paid to do.
</P>
<P>
As The Times points out, the initiative process provides an important "safety
value" for the people of California, but as important as this process is, it
can and should be improved.

OUR WATER FUTURE CAN'T BE TIED UP 40 YEARS IN THE PAST
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE MILLER, Rep. George Miller, a Democrat, represents the 7th District
of California.
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forty years ago, Harry Truman was President, Frank Sinatra was a teen idol, and
no one had ever heard of Watchman, Walkman, or "rock 'n' roll."
</P>
<P>
And 40 years ago, the federal government began selling water from its dams and
reservoirs, permitting crops and cities to flourish where once only desert
existed.
</P>
<P>
Now, the departing Reaganites in the Department of the Interior, at the urging
of subsidized farmers in California, want to return to that bygone era and to
finance their fantasy with your tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the late '40s, Americans didn't worry much about inflation, environmental
quality or toxic pollution. Little thought was given to public-works subsidies
or the ecological damage that such projects might cause. Nor were our current
concerns about droughts as pronounced, since the federal project appeared to
provide more water than Californians could even anticipate consuming.
</P>
<P>
In the decades since then, we discovered that we had been extremely
shortsighted in much of our planning and forecasting. Congress and the states
have enacted tough laws that require the thorough evaluation of the impact on
environmental quality from public and private projects -- the environmental
impact statements. Government agencies, like private entities, have learned to
comply with the strict requirements of this process.
</P>
<P>
But not the Bureau of Reclamation. Its recent history all too often reflects a
disregard for the spirit of the law and a total indifference to the
environment, which is the responsibility of its parent agency, the Department
of the Interior.
</P>
<P>
Four decades ago, irrigators in the Friant Division of the federal Central
Valley Project secured a 40-year contract for federal irrigation water, paying
a fraction of the true costs of that water back to taxpayers. Friant's
inflation-free contract is about to expire, and the growers are demanding that
the bureau renew it for another 40 years.
</P>
<P>
No one objects to continuing deliveries to Friant. But isn't it prudent, at
least once every 40 years, to reevaluate the volume of water that the
government commits when antiquated contracts expire? Isn't it appropriate, once
every two generations, to ask some basic questions:
</P>
<P>
 -- Does Friant really need all the water it has been receiving, or could
improved conservation and better management reduce the volume?
</P>
<P>
 -- Given the enormous changes in the California population and economy over
the next four decades, should irrevocable commitments of public resources be
made through the year 2029? Should water contracts instead be for 10-year
periods, or 20, to permit periodic reevaluation and modification?
</P>
<P>
 -- What are the ecological consequences of the Friant deliveries? We have
learned that irrigation in the Central Valley has produced an unanticipated
ecological catastrophe at the Kesterson wildlife refuge; are there any negative
impacts resulting from the Friant contract that, at least, ought to be
identified and addressed as part of any contract renewal?
</P>
<P>
 -- And might others in California -- more efficient irrigators, fish and
wildlife, or urban users like those in Los Angeles -- make better use of a
portion of the Friant supply?
</P>
<P>
These, and other pertinent questions, could best be answered through completion
of a thorough environmental review of the request for contract renewal. But in
an extraordinary decision, the Department of Interior recently rejected the
need for an environmental impact statement on the new Friant contract, arguing
instead that the government must renew existing contracts -- not just as
Friant, but throughout California.
</P>
<P>
The decision, in effect, argues that in the case of Bureau of Reclamation water
contracts, we who live in the late 1980s are bound by the decisions of those in
the 1940s -- no questions asked. Forget the efforts to slash the federal
deficit and public subsidies; forget the drought and the need to demand
efficiency in water use; forget the growth in California and the changes that
have occurred in agriculture over the last 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The most outrageous aspect of the Interior Department's decision is not that we
cannot order changes when necessary, but that public officials cannot even ask
the prudent questions that should govern the commitment of public resources.
How will the residents of Los Angeles, or Fresno, or Northern California
respond when told that there is no more water for them, despite the expenditure
of billions in tax dollars on developing additional supplies, because all the
water was committed 40 years ago?
</P>
<P>
Neither we in government, nor taxpayers, nor those who will invariably (and
rightfully) sue to overturn the department's preposterous position should have
to even raise these questions. It should go without saying that when a public
agency has the opportunity to reevaluate a major policy decision 40 years after
it was initiated, it should carefully review that decision in light of
contemporary concerns. If the Interior Department's legal experts don't think
so -- they should think again.

Variety Baby used the middle of the track to overtake favorite T.V. of Crystal
and win the $82,800 La Brea Stakes by a half length Sunday at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
The La Brea is the first of three races for 4-year-old fillies in the La Canada
Series, which also includes the $100,000 El Encino Stakes, Jan. 21, and the
$200,000-added La Canada Stakes, Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
Variety Baby, ridden by Corey Black, came into the stretch four wide and wore
down T.V. of Crystal in the final sixteenth. Sent off as second choice of the
crowd of 34,606, Variety Baby covered the 7 furlongs in 1:21 3-5 and paid $7,
$3.20, $2.80.
</P>
<P>
T.V. of Crystal, ridden by Chris McCarron, paid $3.20 and $2.80. Forewarning,
ridden by Laffit Pincay Jr., was another 4 1/2 lengths back in the field of 8
and paid $4.40 to show.
</P>
<P>
Variety Baby, trained by Bruce Headley, earned $40,050 for owner and breeder,
Kjell H. Qvale.
</P>
<P>
The first 3 horses carried 117 pounds each.

Al Iafrate scored a power-play goal with 6:23 remaining in regulation time to
give the Toronto Maple Leafs a 3-3 tie with the Blackhawks Sunday night at
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Toronto, which trailed 3-1 after two periods, got to within one goal at 9:45 of
the third period when ex-Blackhawk Ed Olczyk banged his own rebound past
replacement goaltender Ed Belfour for his 21st goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
Belfour replaced Darren Pang 5:19 into the third period after Pang was injured
during a goal-mouth scramble.
</P>
<P>
Iafrate tied the game when he beat Belfour with a 40-foot slap shot at 13:37
for his sixth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
Chicago took a 2-0 lead on first-period goals by Wayne Presley and Dave Manson.
Presley, who had not scored since Dec. 14, beat Toronto goaltender Ken Wregget
to his glove side with a 25-foot slap shot from the left circle at 8:07, and
Manson beat Wregget to the glove side with a 30-footer at 9:34 during a power
play.
</P>
<P>
Montreal 4, Vancouver 0 -- Patrick Roy stopped 39 shots for his third shutout
of the season as the Montreal Canadiens extended their winning streak to 8
games with a win over the Canucks in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
Montreal, which has won 5 in a row on the road, has lost only once in its last
14 games. The Canadiens lead second-place Boston by 21 points in the Adams
Division.

NEWSWIRE: NYKANEN WINS SKI-JUMP LEG; THOMA FOURTH
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Olympic triple gold medalist Matti Nykanen of Finland won the second leg of the
traditional Four-Hill ski jumping tour by soaring 109 and 102 meters in his two
jumps at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, West Germany.
</P>
<P>
West German Dieter Thoma, who won the first segment of the event in Oberstdorf
two days earlier, managed only a fourth-place finish in the second leg but held
on to his lead in both the Four-Hill tournament and the World Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
Thoma had jumps of 104.5 and 102.5 meters Sunday, trailing second-place
finisher Jens Weissflog of East Germany and Finland's Risto Laakonen, who came
in third.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Thoma swept down the track after his first jump, visibly
angered that he had to land prematurely when a strong sidewind began pushing
him wide of the track.
</P>
<P>
Weissflog had jumps of 104 and 100 meters and Laakonen landed with 107.5 and
99.5 in his two attempts, both earning more style points from the judges than
did Thoma to finish ahead of the tournament leader.

A stagehands strike in Toronto forced cancellation of the National Ballet of
Canada's last sold-out holiday performances last year of "The Nutcracker." Four
matinee and evening performances of the traditional ballet and one of the
farcical "Nutty Nutcracker" were canceled from Thursday to Saturday. "The union
refuses to put stagehands on the job while mediation talks are in session,"
Charles Cutts, general manager of the O'Keefe Center, said in a statement. The
O'Keefe's theater seats 3,000. The National Ballet has been performing the
holiday favorite annually since 1964. The International Alliance of Theatrical
Stage Employees' local and the center are in a dispute over the use of outside
technical workers by touring productions. STEVE WEINSTEIN and DAVID CROOK

Actor Martin Sheen won a ruling Thursday from the Nevada Supreme Court
overturning a requirement that he post a $5,000 bond aimed at stopping a
protest trespass at the Nevada Test Site. Sheen, active in the movement against
nuclear testing, was forced to post the "peace bond" after saying on national
television he would "hopefully commit civil disobedience" at the test site. In
reversing District Judge Bill Beko of Tonopah, the Supreme Court said in its
2-page order that prosecutors conceded that civil disobedience isn't a crime in
Nevada. STEVE WEINSTEIN and DAVID CROOK

MACAL LEADS PACIFIC SYMPHONY
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With each guest conductor leading the Pacific Symphony while the search for a
new music director goes on, the orchestra has responded with alertness and
security.
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee Symphony music director Zdenek Macal took his turn Saturday with a
New Year's Eve pops program at the Orange County Performing Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
Macal is an interesting conductor to watch. He feints, he jabs, he flirts, he
pouts, he argues, he suffers. He plucks notes out of the air. He directs
finger-shimmies at the musicians. He crouches to half his height for the right
pianissimo, rises to bring the music to a climax and finishes with little,
happy jumping hops. He is capable of singing along with the players at the most
expressive moments.
</P>
<P>
For all that, the Pacific rarely gave him expressiveness to match, and it may
not have been entirely the orchestra's fault.
</P>
<P>
While always enforcing clarity, balance, proportion, exactness and discipline,
Macal eschewed flights of lyricism or poetry. He could be fussy in detail, yet
cool in overall aim and phrasing.
</P>
<P>
The overtures to Strauss' "Die Fledermaus" and Offenbach's "Orpheus in the
Underworld" were vigorous and clean, but not sweet or sparkling. Even
Offenbach's famous cancan lacked a sense of fun.
</P>
<P>
The conductor and pianist Jeffrey Siegel pretty much missed the style boat in
Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue." Macal took a Teutonic, declamatory approach to
the work, while Siegel viewed it as if he were playing Tchaikovsky's virtuosic
First Concerto or perhaps one of Prokofiev's keen-edged works.
</P>
<P>
Siegel stabbed at the sustaining pedal with his right foot, kept time by
tapping with his left, thundered at the keyboard with steely facility and
occasionally veered into honky-tonk style as if an inner voice suddenly nagged,
"Jazz score . . . Jazz score. . . ." But it was a sometime thing.
</P>
<P>
Macal enforced such rigid rhythms that when the big tune arrived, it sounded
fatigued and oddly accented. Clarinetist Emily Bernstein, who in other works
offered fine playing, proved tentative and inexpressive in the famous opening
solo.
</P>
<P>
Everyone came off best in the Suite from Strauss' "Der Rosenkavalier." The
orchestra sounded strong and secure, and Macal conveyed sweep and power but
only a little of the poignancy and intoxication of this magical score.

A provincial court in Egypt has ordered the television series "Falcon Crest"
off the air on grounds it undermines public morals, according to a newspaper
report. The newspaper Wafd, published by a centrist opposition party of the
same name, said Thursday the ruling banning the show was in a provincial court
in the Nile Valley town of Shibin el-Kom. "Falcon Crest" began appearing
several years ago on local television and quickly became a favorite among both
poor and wealthy Egyptians, despite its depiction of a society generally
foreign to the mostly conservative Egyptians. Television censors, for example,
routinely cut kissing scenes from "Falcon Crest" that they consider too
passionate. The TV series "Dallas," a predecessor of "Falcon Crest," also was
widely popular until it was stopped six years ago after a member of parliament
complained it was corrupting the morals of Egyptian youth. STEVE WEINSTEIN and

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: DOCUMENTARY SERIES FOCUSES ON SOCIAL ISSUES
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four feature-length documentaries on social and political issues will be shown
over the next three weekends at the Monica 4-Plex. They will be screened
Saturday and Sunday mornings simultaneously but with staggered starting times:
Cathy Zheutlin's "Just One Step: The Great Peace March" (10:15), Martyn Burke's
"Witnesses: Afghanistan -- The Untold Story" (10:30), Morley Markson's "Growing
Up in America" (10:45) and Beverly Shaffer's "To a Safer Place" (11).
</P>
<P>
All of them are worthy rather than dazzling efforts, and they all tend to pound
out the points that their makers wish to make.
</P>
<P>
The most affecting is "To a Safer Place," an occasionally awkward and
self-conscious but rewarding study of Shirley Turcotte, a 36-year-old Vancouver
phone company executive, wife and mother, who reveals her nightmarish
childhood. From the time she was a toddler until she was at last able to escape
to a foster home at 14, she was the victim of her brutal father's incest. By
the time Turcotte was filmed she had already pretty much come to terms with her
past and had become an activist in the prevention of child abuse; consequently,
the film is more in the spirit of advocacy rather than self-discovery. Even so,
her conversations with her family and even former neighbors are strong stuff,
and the film makes clear the awful helplessness and guilt of the abused child.
</P>
<P>
"Just One Step: The Great Peace March" captures the tremendously spiritual
experience those 500 anti-war, anti-nuke protesters underwent in the course of
their 1986 nine-month march from Los Angeles to Washington. Unfortunately, the
film in its attempt to hammer home its message becomes repetitive and wearying
long before the marchers reach the District of Columbia. There are some nifty
moments along the way, however -- e.g., the elderly man who runs the Reagan
Information Center in the President's hometown, Dixon, Ill., and who reasons
that "more bombs make for more jobs."
</P>
<P>
"Witnesses" is an illuminating, comprehensive and utterly relentless account of
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, focusing on the incredibly brave, resilient
and unyielding Afghans and a remarkable band of Westerners who are trying to
come to their aid. This is a sobering, invaluable account of a war that has
been called "Russia's Vietnam," but we're shown so much suffering that the film
becomes numbing.
</P>
<P>
On a lighter note "Growing Up in America" contrasts footage of a group of '60s
radicals with contemporary interviews with them. Inevitably, there's Abbie
Hoffman, who has kept the faith, Jerry Rubin, who thinks he has, even though
he's become a Manhattan entrepreneur, and Allen Ginsberg, who remains
wonderfully transcendent no matter how often he shows up in such documentaries.
Of the 10 subjects attorney William Kunstler is by far the most incisive. While
acknowledging that he has lived a good, fulfilling life he stresses that in
regard to racism and other social ills, America has actually changed very
little since the '60s.
</P>
<P>
Monica 4-Plex information: (213) 394-9741.
</P>
<P>
As a curtain-raiser to its weekend morning New Chinese Cinema series, the Nuart
is presenting Sunday and next Monday Xie Fei and U Lan's exquisite "Girl From
Hunan," adapted from a 60-year-old classic novel by Shen Congwen that indicts
the cruelty of child marriage. As it tells of the fate of a 16-year-old peasant
girl, Xiao Xiao (Na Renhua), already married for four years to a boy a decade
her junior, it exudes a sensuality that has been exceedingly rare in the
Chinese cinema and has some nude scenes that are, in fact, regarded as a first.
</P>
<P>
At first Xiao Xiao's life seems reasonably idyllic -- for one thing she somehow
escaped having her feet bound -- but then she and a farmhand (Deng Xiaotung),
too poor to afford a wife, become mutually attracted. Considering the zealous
puritanism of their community the film concludes surprisingly (though not
without irony). The film is set in 1910 but it might as well be antiquity, yet
it's clear that its feminist sentiments are meant to reverberate in today's
China. For full schedule: (213) 478-6379, 479-5269.

ISRAEL BANISHES 15 ARABS IN BID TO CURB UPRISING
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israel on Sunday banished 15 Palestinians considered to be activist leaders of
the Arab uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in an apparent
challenge to the United States, which has condemned such actions in the past.
</P>
<P>
The expulsions followed the close of one of the bloodiest months in the
uprising, now nearly 13 months old. According to data compiled by an Israeli
member of Parliament, Israeli soldiers shot and killed 31 Arabs during December
and wounded another 400.
</P>
<P>
More than 330 Palestinians have died during the uprising. Ten Israeli Jews and
one Israeli Arab also have been killed. A total of 51 Arabs have been banished
from the country during the intifada, as the uprising is called in Arabic.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flown to Lebanon
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army flew the 15 by helicopter to southern Lebanon, where they were
each given $50 taxi fare, Israel Radio reported. The 15 then headed for an
office of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a radical faction
of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
Two of the Palestinians taken out of the country Sunday agreed to leave after
giving up their court appeals in return for the right to come home in five
years -- provided they refrain from taking part in "negative actions" against
Israel. The rest refused the deal and are barred "for life."
</P>
<P>
The banishment was "due to their involvement in the leadership of the uprising
and the direction of it," an army spokesman declared.
</P>
<P>
The United States has opposed expulsions as a violation of due process as well
as of the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention, which forbids the removal of civilians
from land under military occupation "for any reason whatsoever."
</P>
<P>
There was no reaction Sunday from the State Department.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian observers lashed out at the Israeli move. "The timing is
atrocious," Palestinian lawyer Jonathan Kuttab said. "When people are beginning
to talk solutions, talk peace, the Israelis create frustration."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeals to U.S.
</P>
<P>
Kuttab called on Washington to put some bite into its customary condemnation of
the expulsions.
</P>
<P>
The United States recently dropped a 13-year prohibition and opened contact
with the PLO, to which most Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza owe their political
loyalty. "The strength of the United States criticism of Israel will be a test
of its intentions to foster peace," Kuttab argued.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said the newly expelled Arabs played "leading roles" in the
intifada and that most belonged to Fatah, the mainstream PLO faction headed by
Yasser Arafat. Among the 15, the radio singled out four for special mention:
</P>
<P>
 -- Rizek Bayari, 29, a journalist who led popular committees in the northern
Gaza Strip and was charged with "directing violence" in Gaza.
</P>

 -- Abdallah abu Samahadana, 38, a lecturer at Islamic University in Gaza.
Samahadana spent four years in jail on charges of transporting hand grenades
and was released last year.
</P>
<P>
 -- Massoud Zaefer, 42, a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine who was a leader of the uprising in Nablus, the largest and most
militant Palestinian city on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
 -- Abdel Hamid Baba, 25, a Fatah activist in the Amari refugee camp who is
reported to be responsible for violence in Ramallah, a West Bank city north of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said that the expulsions, in the works since August, were
timed to coincide with Sunday's 24th anniversary of the first PLO guerrilla
operation inside Israel, observed by the Palestinians as "Fatah Day." The
timing was a means of depressing Palestinian morale, the source said. In an
attempt at showing its psychological impact, the official compared the action
to a military raid Dec. 9 on a PLO faction's headquarters in Lebanon. That raid
coincided with the first anniversary of the intifada.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Local Committees Targeted
</P>
<P>
Removal of Palestinian leaders has been part of an Israeli effort to break the
back of so-called popular committees that have spearheaded Arab resistance to
Israeli rule in the occupied territories. Last August, Israeli authorities
accused the 15 Palestinians of leading the committees in various localities and
prepared the cases for expulsion.
</P>
<P>
At the time, a Defense Ministry spokesman said the popular committees were
designed "to impose by violent means the orders of the PLO and the uprising's
leaders on the population, to undermine the Israeli authorities . . . and to
create alternative mechanisms instead."
</P>
<P>
The number of December clashes and the expulsions appeared to be a concrete
sign of Israel's tough defiance of efforts in the international community to
encourage peace talks by Israel with the PLO. Israel refuses to make contact
with the organization, which it believes is unswervingly bent on destroying the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials insist that peace talks with non-PLO Palestinians must be
preceded by an end to the intifada. In the meantime, Israeli army officials
have pledged to take the fight to stone-throwing youths in Arab towns and
villages.
</P>
<P>
Last August, the Israeli army authorized occupying soldiers in the West Bank
and Gaza to use so-called plastic bullets, whose lethal range is said to be
less than that of full-metal projectiles. When the bullets were introduced,
firing rules were relaxed; it no longer was necessary for a "life threatening"
situation to arise before troops could shoot into crowds or at individuals.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin predicted that the bullets would increase the
number of wounded but reduce the number of dead.
</P>
<P>
The prediction about fatalities is debatable. In the close quarters of Arab
neighborhoods, the plastic bullets -- actually a blend of plastic and metal --
have proved as lethal as regular cartridges. In August, more than 20 Arabs were
shot to death. The toll dipped in both September and October, climbed to 20
again in November and surged to 31 in December.
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 16, paratroopers based in Nablus shot and killed eight Palestinians
during unrest that followed a funeral for an earlier victim -- the highest
one-day fatal toll in a single city since the uprising began. Arabs have taken
to calling the shootings "the Nablus massacre."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
40 Killed in April
</P>
<P>
The only month to top December in carnage was last April, when more than 40
Palestinians were killed.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Yossi Sarid, a member of Israel's Parliament from the leftist
Citizens' Rights Party, wrote to Defense Minister Rabin to protest the use of
plastic bullets.
</P>
<P>
"When Israel started using plastic bullets, the basic assumption was: They
don't kill," Sarid said in an interview. "This evidently is not the case. The
use of the bullets is intolerable. The death figures are horrible."
</P>
<P>
A few days earlier, Israel's attorney general, Yosef Harish, said he would
investigate the use of the bullets. His report would not be officially binding,
but, as legal adviser to the government, his opinion might have some impact,
Israeli observers say.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the army imposed a curfew on the entire Gaza Strip in an effort to
prevent protests or violence connected to the PLO anniversary.
</P>
<P>
During the day, at least five Palestinians were wounded by army gunfire, Arab
sources said. The army reported that two teen-agers were shot in the legs when
soldiers fired at dozens of stone-throwing youths in Ramallah, on the West
Bank.

<P>
A Brazilian excursion ship jammed with New Year's revelers bound for a
fireworks display capsized and sank after ignoring an order to return to port,
officials said Sunday. At least 51 people died.
</P>
<P>
The sightseeing ship was carrying at least 131 people -- above its reported
capacity of 100 -- and sank in 65 feet of water in Rio's Guanabara Bay about
11:45 p.m. Saturday, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know the exact cause of the sinking, but we think it was because of
excess capacity," said Maj. Oldemiro Santos of the Fire Department's maritime
group in Rio de Janeiro state.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said 51 bodies have been recovered and a search for survivors is
continuing. Some passengers are believed trapped in the hull of the vessel,
said Col. Jefferson Cardoso de Bem, chief of the maritime group. Among the dead
was the boat's captain.
</P>
<P>
The ship was so crowded that a naval vessel ordered it to return to port, but
it ignored the order, said Irineu Barroso, chief of Rio's 10th police precinct.
Some survivors confirmed that account, saying the ship had been stopped by
officials and ordered to shore but that it set out a second time.
</P>
<P>
De Bem said he had no accurate number of survivors or of the number missing
because several boats took part in rescue attempts, and survivors were taken to
hospitals throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
The boat, a popular tourist attraction that offers daily cruises of the bay,
was to anchor in the Atlantic Ocean so passengers could view the midnight
fireworks display at Copacabana Beach. The $220-per-ticket dinner cruise was
heavily promoted in local newspapers and at tourist hotels.
</P>
<P>
The double-decked ship Bateau Mouche sank between Sugar Loaf Mountain and a
small island as it rounded the bend on the western side of Guanabara Bay near
the ocean.
</P>
<P>
"The top deck was so crowded you could hardly move," a Brazilian woman told
Brazil's TV Globo. "The boat was completely full, including lots of children.
Then everything began shaking back and forth. People were shouting: 'It's going
to flip over!' "
</P>
<P>
Passenger Fabricio Calo, who was rescued by a fishing boat, said: "The boat was
turning and shifting. Then tables started flying, glass started crashing, and
the whole boat just turned over on its side."
</P>
<P>
"This was not an accident," said one passenger, a business executive from Sao
Paulo. "No effort was made to control the number of passengers who got on."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Didn't Want to Go'
</P>
<P>
Paulo Soares, 28, a brother-in-law of the Bateau Mouche's captain, Camilo da
Costa, 50, said at the mooring station: "Camilo didn't want to go out. He said
the boat was overloaded, and the sea was too rough. But he had no choice. He
would lose his job if he didn't sail."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Sol e Mar restaurant, which organized the excursion, said
at least 131 people were on board, according to an incomplete reservation list.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, refused further comment.
</P>
<P>
The Rio newspaper O Globo reported Sunday that an American may have been on
board. The U.S. Consulate said it was not authorized to give out any
information about possible U.S. victims.
</P>
<P>
The vessel capsized quickly, according to passenger Hans Leutner, 56. The West
German said: "It was clear that the boat was overloaded. As it was going out,
it was not very high in the water.
</P>
<P>
"The boat tipped slightly to one side and did not come back," Leutner said. "In
half a minute it had gone."
</P>
<P>
On television, former Planning Minister Anibal Teixeira fought back tears as he
spoke of the disaster in which his wife, Maria Jose Andrade Teixeira de Souza,
died.
</P>
<P>
Christine Adam, 34, said she tugged an officer's shirt to ask: "Aren't we
overloaded?" Adam, a French citizen, reported that he told her not to worry.
</P>
<P>
Her husband Jean, 43, who once sailed with the French navy, said he didn't
believe the flat-keeled boat was suitable for seagoing trips.
</P>
<P>
He said he had been thrown into the sea and returned to the sinking ship for
his wife, a poor swimmer. He failed to find her, but the two were reunited on
shore.
</P>
<P>
"She had the sort of luck you have only once in your life," Adam said. A
passenger gave her a chair that she held onto until rescued by fishermen.

<TEXT>
<P>
There's good news for people concerned about the spread of AIDS and widened
drug use, but there's bad news for new-car dealers and shady travel promoters
who like to cut corners to make a quick buck. Taking effect on New Year's Day
were many of the 1,647 bills passed by the Legislature and signed into law by
Gov. George Deukmejian during 1988. Here's a sampling of the new laws and what
they do:

IN NEW YEAR'S DAY PRAYER, HE URGES COMMITMENT TO COMBAT EVIL

<TEXT>
<P>
Pope John Paul II on Sunday urged Christians and "all men of good will" to
commit themselves to building peace and justice in the New Year.
</P>
<P>
The Pope, observing the Roman Catholic Church's traditional "World Day of
Peace," spoke from his Vatican apartment to 30,000 pilgrims and tourists massed
in brilliant sunshine in St. Peter's Square for the noon Angelus prayer
traditionally held on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
Before the prayer, John Paul celebrated High Mass in St. Peter's Basilica,
where he repeated his dedication to the rights of racial minorities in 1989 and
the duty of governments to protect them.
</P>
<P>
"The New Year that begins today is under the sign of the maternity of Maria,
queen of peace, almost to signify a new hope, a renewed purpose," John Paul
said in his address broadcast throughout the world by Vatican Radio.
</P>
<P>
"If the forces of evil and hate insist in their destructive activity, we, the
disciples of the Lord and of Mary, will insist still more, together with all
men of good will, in the commitment to the building of peace and justice," the
Pope said.
</P>
<P>
At the High Mass, attended by some 10,000 pilgrims and diplomats accredited to
the Holy See, John Paul prayed that "the face of the Lord" will rest upon the
world in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
"We express the wish that it may be the year of peace, of justice and of
growing solidarity, of social solicitude for each person and for everybody,"
the Pope said. "May peace, justice and solidarity grow in men and society.
</P>
<P>
"May they grow and mature in human consciences, as also in the daily toil of
conscience and willingness," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Pope recalled that the Second Vatican Council, held in the 1960s, declared
that "in all the nations of the Earth there exists a single people of God."
</P>
<P>
"Precisely because of this, on this day the church thinks of all men of the
entire planet, of all nations, in which each person finds his own human roots
and his own identity," he said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rights of Racial Minorities
</P>
<P>
John Paul quoted excerpts from his message for World Peace Day, published by
the Vatican on Dec. 9 and dedicated this year to the rights of racial
minorities and the duty of all states to protect them.
</P>
<P>
"Respect for minority groups should be considered, in some way, the touchstone
for harmonious social coexistence and as an index of the civil maturity
achieved by a country and its institutions," the Pope said, quoting from his
message.
</P>
<P>
"Guaranteeing the participation of minorities in public life is a sign of
elevated civil progress, and this turns to the honor of those nations in which
all citizens are guaranteed such participation in a climate of true liberty,"
he said.

Eleven Filipinos were killed and about 2,000 injured in firecracker blasts,
stabbings and shootings during New Year's revelry, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Police said two people died in blazes sparked in Manila slums by firecracker
explosions. Filipinos traditionally set off firecrackers and shoot guns into
the air to usher in the New Year.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned Philippines News Agency, quoting police officials in the
capital, said the celebration was relatively peaceful.
</P>
<P>
Hospital workers said five people were shot to death and 11 injured, most by
stray bullets. Three men were stabbed to death and 14 reported hurt in drunken
knife fights.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Killed by Bomb
</P>
<P>
The news agency said a man died when a homemade bomb hurled at him exploded on
his chest.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 people were taken to hospitals for cuts, burns and other blast
injuries as well as stab wounds, it said.
</P>
<P>
The firecracker blasts ignited blazes in six Manila districts. More than 14,000
people were reported to have lost their homes in the fires and investigators
put initial property damage estimates at about $2.4 million.

IZVESTIA SAYS A LIGHT-HEARTED GOODBY TO 1988
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The newspaper Izvestia said goodby to 1988 with a good measure of humor Sunday,
saying it hadn't been hard to give up one-candidate elections, jammed radio
programs and other former staples of Soviet life abolished last year.
</P>
<P>
The government newspaper toasted many changes made during 1988, including the
improvement in supplies at liquor stores, which resulted from the Kremlin's
realization that its crackdown on alcohol had created a massive network of
moonshine distillers.
</P>
<P>
"Let's raise our glasses to it (1988), because among other things it helped us
get rid of the lines for this holiday drink," Izvestia's correspondent Yuri
Makarov wrote in a rare bit of levity published in the central Soviet press.
</P>
<P>
The article was headlined "Congratulations on the Old Year."
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the events of 1988, Izvestia said goodby to West German daredevil
pilot Mathias Rust, who was allowed to return home in August after serving 14
months of a four-year sentence for making an unauthorized landing in Red
Square.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Madcap Inspector'
</P>
<P>
"Auf wiedersehen Mathias Rust, madcap inspector of our anti-aircraft defenses,"
Izvestia said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper saluted the dramatic changes that took place in the Soviet Union
last year as the country pursued Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
perestroika program of political and economic reform and his glasnost policy of
openness.
</P>
<P>
Many government bureaucrats were sent to work in industry as ministries were
slashed or reduced, and multi-candidate elections to a new two-tiered
Parliament were scheduled for 1989 as part of sweeping constitutional changes.
</P>
<P>
"Farewell to the exciting election of one deputy from one candidate," Izvestia
said.
</P>
<P>
"We bade farewell to some officials who ruled our country. . . . We bade
farewell to a number of ministries and branches despite their desire to stay
on. How invincible and compulsory they seemed to be for many years!"
</P>
<P>
Of the decision to stop jamming foreign radio broadcasts, Izvestia said
tongue-in-cheek that it was difficult to abandon the belief that millions of
dollars must be spent "to save our ears from the misinformation of foreign
radios."
</P>
<P>
Izvestia praised another new direction of glasnost taken in 1988 -- the end to
the intentional distortion of maps.
</P>
<P>
"It was also difficult for us to abandon the conviction that maps of our
country are issued only to mislead foreign spies," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Now better maps are being issued "and a precise map of Moscow can be bought not
just in London."
</P>
<P>
Places and institutions re-named after Leonid I. Brezhnev and Konstantin U.
Chernenko, former Soviet leaders now officially linked with stagnation, resumed
their old names last year -- another change praised by Izvestia.
</P>
<P>
"We departed from the city of Brezhnev with a light heart," the newspaper said.
The old name of the city on the Volga, Naberezhniye Chelny, was restored last
January.
</P>
<P>
"Goodby, 1988. You were a good year. But at the same time you were a difficult
year, and frankly speaking, it is a good thing that you are leaving," Izvestia
said.

KABUL, SOVIETS DECLARE CEASE-FIRE BUT REBELS ATTACK 2 VILLAGES

The Soviet-backed Afghan government began a cease-fire on New Year's Day, but
U.S.-backed Muslim rebels rejected the truce and attacked government troops in
two villages, Kabul Radio said.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire offer was made Friday by Afghan President Najibullah, and the
Soviet Union announced Saturday that its troops would join the truce.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address to his nation Sunday, Najibullah complained that rebels
have expanded operations against his government and repeated his offer of
direct talks with them, the official Soviet news agency Tass reported. He also
rejected any future Afghan government that excludes the present leadership,
Tass said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels recently opened talks with Soviet representatives.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas attacked government troops Sunday in two villages in eastern
Nangarahar province, Kabul Radio reported in a broadcast monitored in
Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The radio said eight guerrillas were killed and seven wounded in the attack on
the military posts in Gushta and Deh Bala. It gave no casualty figures for
government troops, but it said that soldiers launched mopping-up operations
against the rebels after the attack.
</P>
<P>
Rebel leader Ahmad Shah said the cease-fire was "a condemnable suggestion."
</P>
<P>
The seven-party Guerrilla Alliance named Shah head of a provisional Islamic
government, that has yet to be installed.
</P>
<P>
"It only shows how desperate Najib is," Shah said in a statement issued in
Peshawar, Pakistan. "Najib has repeatedly proposed such meaningless
cease-fires, but every time we rejected them."
</P>
<P>
Rebel spokesman Masood Khalili said of Najibullah's offer: "We did not start
our fight because he asked us to. And we won't stop because he asked us to."
</P>
<P>
Khalili belongs to the Jamaat-i-Islami guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 Soviet soldiers marched into Afghanistan in 1979 to help the
Marxist government fight Muslim rebels.
</P>
<P>
Half the Soviet troops left last year under the terms of a U.N.-brokered accord
signed in Geneva by Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United States and the Soviet
Union. The rest of the Soviet troops are to withdraw by Feb. 15.

THATCHER SPURNS REVENGE IN JET BOMBING

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher distanced herself on Sunday from U.S. vows to
punish whoever planted the bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think an eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth is ever valid," she said
in a wide-ranging New Year's television interview.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing to do is to try to get the cooperation of all nations
to track these people down so that they are brought to justice," she said on
the "David Frost on Sunday" program.
</P>
<P>
The danger of revenge, she said, is that "it can affect innocent people."
</P>
<P>
President Reagan said in his weekly radio broadcast Saturday that the United
States would punish those responsible for the bomb, which brought the Boeing
747 down in southern Scotland, killing all 259 people on board and at least 11
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Reagan said a report overseen by President-elect George Bush advocating
possible military action against terrorists "ought to be giving some people
sleepless nights" in the wake of the Dec. 21 bombing. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Seek Hard, Punish Firmly'
</P>
<P>
Bush vowed last week to "seek hard and punish firmly, decisively, those who did
this, if you could ever find them."
</P>
<P>
Thatcher allowed Reagan to use U.S. bombers based in Britain to bomb Libya in
1986 in retaliation for alleged Libyan involvement in international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
She said Sunday that no country should grant the Pan Am terrorists safe haven
or permit them to escape justice.
</P>
<P>
"I think public opinion is disgusted with nations that will not try to track
down terrorists, absolutely disgusted."
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say no group has offered a credible claim of responsibility for
the attack. Speculation on suspects has focused mostly on Palestinian
extremists and pro-Iranian Shia Muslims.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Celebrations
</P>
<P>
Searchers in Lockerbie, Scotland, gave up their traditional New Year's
celebrations Sunday to continue the hunt for bodies and wreckage.
</P>
<P>
Police said that one more body, thought to be one of the missing local
residents, was recovered, bringing the total to 242.
</P>
<P>
Only 35 have been identified and released to relatives for burial. Capt. Bruce
Smith, a Pan Am pilot whose English wife, Ingrid, was killed, was quoted in the
Sunday Telegraph as saying the Scottish police were "paralyzed by inexperience
and incompetence."
</P>
<P>
John Boyd, chief constable of the Dumfries and Galloway police, replied at a

More than 700 people are expected at a memorial service Wednesday in Lockerbie,
and 1,000 more will watch on monitor screens in nearby halls.
</P>
<P>
British newspapers reported Saturday that investigators believe the bomb was
smuggled onto the flight in Frankfurt, possibly by a Lebanese-born passenger
duped into carrying it. The West German government said no evidence supports
those reports.
</P>
<P>
Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt with a Boeing 727 jet and switched to a
Boeing 747 at London's Heathrow Airport for the trip to New York.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times of London said the bomb was loaded into the airplane's forward
cargo hold next to the electronic nerve center that keeps the jet airborne.

DEMOLITION IS STOPPED ON HISTORIC MCKINLEY HOUSE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Italian Renaissance-styled McKinley Mansion, which is on Los Angeles'
official list of historic-cultural monuments, was saved from the wrecker's ball
over the weekend after a city building inspector arrived on the scene and
declared that a demolition permit had been issued by mistake.
</P>
<P>
Contractors hired by owner Jason Lee had been at work an hour or more and did
what could be thousands of dollars in damage before building inspector Michael
D. Tharpe ordered them to stop demolishing the $4.5-million property at 301 S.
Lafayette Park Place on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
By the time neighbors' complaints and police inquiries had brought out the
building inspector, the wreckers had smashed the front patio superstructure,
wrecked the adjacent arbors and made a number of gashes in the main part of the
house, including exposing the wood frame on the southwest corner.
</P>
<P>
Lee said Sunday that his contractors had obtained the demolition permit from
the city Friday afternoon, and he believed that he was fully authorized to
destroy the 13,000-square-foot house, built in 1917 and named for the late
mortuary operator, Maytor H. McKinley. Lee wants to remove the house to make
way for a 140-unit apartment house.
</P>
<P>
However, an official of the Los Angeles Conservancy, Christy McAvoy, said a
demolition permit cannot legitimately be issued, pending completion of an
environmental impact report and exploration of alternative uses for the
property.
</P>
<P>
"The owners were aware of that, but they evidently took advantage of the
situation in the city offices on the eve of a holiday," she said. "The permits
division may have been shorthanded. These properties are supposed to be clearly
flagged in the city's files, however, so I really don't know how they got the
permit.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very saddened by the owners' action. We had a substantial communication
with them, and the situation had been fully explained to them. I'm deeply
disappointed that they chose to do this."
</P>
<P>
Lee, who said he has owned the property for about seven months, said he had
grown tired of waiting for the city to act and told his contractors this fall
to see what they could do about getting a demolition permit.
</P>
<P>
He said that the city's building inspector had told him he was stopping the
demolition only until Tuesday, when the city would decide what to do next.
</P>
<P>
Lee showed the permit his contractors had obtained to a reporter Sunday. He
also displayed a city report saying that the Cultural Heritage Board had lifted
a 180-day stay on issuing a demolition permit last March and said he knew
nothing about any requirement for an environmental impact report.
</P>
<P>
Present at the house Sunday was another man, Rod Daniels, a San Fernando Valley
developer who said he has been seeking permission to move the house to
Chatsworth and that he would like to live in it. It has also been proposed that
the house be left where it is and used as an AIDS hospice.

<P>
A 6-year-old boy was killed and a 5-year-old girl critically injured Sunday
afternoon by a hit-and-run driver whose car dragged them for nearly a
half-block in Long Beach, police said.
</P>
<P>
So Den Tang was killed and Anika Elk was in critical condition after the
driver's older-model Lincoln Continental struck them as they crossed Alamitos
Street at 17th Street about 3:30 p.m., Long Beach Police Lt. Craig Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
"He just kept on going after dragging them under his car," Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
The two children were taken to St. Mary Medical Center, where the boy died a
short time later, he said.

TWO KILLED, WOMAN BADLY HURT IN NEW YEAR'S EVE PLANE CRASH
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man and a woman were killed and another woman critically injured in a New
Year's Eve crash of a single-engine airplane in the snow-covered San Gabriel
Mountains, authorities said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The plane is believed to have gone down about 5 p.m. Saturday, but a search
team, hampered by snow and rain, took more than 16 hours to locate the
wreckage, said Sgt. Tom Federoff of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's
Department.
</P>
<P>
Authorities were alerted to the crash by signals sent by the downed plane's
emergency locater and searchers on Sunday morning found the crash site near Mt.
Baldy. The two women were airlifted to Huntington Memorial Hospital in
Pasadena, where one of them died at 11:30 a.m., a hospital spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The survivor, Jody Pierce, 25, of Santa Barbara, was in serious condition with
abdominal and chest injuries and a fractured leg, nursing supervisor Judy
Pruitt said.
</P>
<P>
Federoff said the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department and the Civil Air Patrol
assisted in the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department could not provide names of the other victims or
details about the flight.

DANA POINT BECOMES A CITY
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The seaside resort of Dana Point on Sunday officially became Orange County's
28th city.
</P>
<P>
During a ceremony aboard a replica of the brig Pilgrim, which carried
19th-Century author and namesake Richard Henry Dana to what he called "the only
romantic spot in California," Dana Point's City Council was sworn in and
Councilwoman Judy Curreri was voted temporary mayor by her colleagues.
</P>
<P>
In a referendum June 7, three-quarters of the voters approved cityhood for the
community of 26,000 between San Clemente and Laguna Beach. The new city
includes the 393-room Ritz-Carlton Hotel, the 350-room Dana Point Resort and
the planned 1,126-room Monarch Beach resort, which are expected to yield
millions of dollars in hotel bed taxes.
</P>
<P>
A consultant estimated that first-year revenues would be about $9 million --
more than enough to provide existing services.
</P>
<P>
A cannon blast -- actually, a 12-gauge shotgun blank -- commemorated the birth
of the municipality Sunday as a red Orange County Sheriff's Harbor Patrol boat
chugged up the channel toward the ship, its sirens wailing and five jets of
water spraying high.

The leader of Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the outlawed Irish
Republican Army, criticized the IRA for killing civilians in a string of
botched attacks in Northern Ireland in 1988. "I think the onus is on the IRA to
safeguard the civilians from injury and death," Gerry Adams said in Belfast. In
its traditional New Year message, the IRA conceded last week that 1988 had been
a difficult year with many of its guerrillas killed and several attacks
bungled. Among the victims killed in IRA bomb attacks intended for other
targets were a family of three returning from a U.S. vacation, two men near a
swimming pool and an elderly man and his granddaughter who were outside an
unmanned police station.

Hundreds of dead birds found along a three-quarter mile stretch of country road
near Austin, Tex., may have been poisoned by a pesticide or other chemical, a
biologist said. Area residents first noticed the dead birds Saturday. Hundreds
of birds were visible from the road, flapping on the ground or dangling from
tree limbs. Hundreds more were dead in fields. The types included brown-headed
cowbirds, Brewer's blackbirds, redwing blackbirds, Eastern meadowlarks,
mourning doves, killdeer and a marsh hawk that died after feeding on a dying
cowbird. Jack Ralph, a contaminants biologist with the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department, said he suspected poisoning, possibly from a type of herbicide,
pesticide or related toxin. "As yet, we can't determine whether this is a
natural or man-made event," Ralph said. He gathered several birds for
laboratory analysis and said test results will be available in about a week.

House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) said higher taxes probably will
be part of a bipartisan compromise budget plan in 1989. Michel said he does not
believe that spending can be cut enough to meet deficit limits set by law. "I
don't know that there is that much flexibility," he said. "I suspect (tax
increases) may be part of the answer." Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole
(R-Kan.), on the other hand, said he takes at face value President-elect George
Bush's stated opposition to a tax hike. Dole said: "I didn't coin the phrase
'read my lips,' but I think (Bush) means it and I don't see any give in that
area at this point." Michel and Dole were guests on ABC-TV's "This Week With
David Brinkley."

A fire swept through a home north of Remer, Minn., killing eight children and
two adults who were baby-sitting, authorities said. The fire spread so quickly
it was unlikely that anyone woke up before being overcome by smoke, Remer Fire
Chief Leo Renn said. The bodies were found still on the couches or beds where
they were sleeping, he said. The victims in the two-story wooden home included
four children of the owners, John Watson and his wife, Nancy, who were not at
home. The names of the victims were not immediately released. Renn said a
wood-burning stove and a fuel-oil space heater were being investigated as
possible causes. In Anchorage, Alaska, two adults and two children died in an
early morning blaze in a trailer house. They were not immediately identified.

Members of a small Oakland church have bought a neighboring motel plagued with
prostitution and drug dealing and plan to reopen it as a low-cost apartment
house. The Rev. George Epps, pastor of the Greater Emmanuel Missionary Baptist
Church, said a nonprofit corporation formed by the church paid $550,000 for the
property with the help of a redevelopment loan from the city. "We saw this as a
great opportunity to try to get in there and make a change," Epps said. The
300-member congregation plans to first overhaul the motel's 22 units.

Politics and sex, the mix that has rocked Greek theater for 2,400 years, is
finding new life in satirical shows that mock Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou
and his relationship with a former flight attendant.
</P>
<P>
Greeks are packing the capital's theaters to laugh at satires of the
69-year-old Socialist premier, who is carrying on a public relationship with
34-year-old Dimitra Liani while his governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement is
besieged by financial scandals.
</P>
<P>
Public affairs -- sexual and political -- have been favorite topics for Greek
comedians since the playwright Aristophanes made the combination a smash hit in
the 5th Century BC.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou's heart operation in London last September inspired the title of a
popular revue, "Post-Aorta Greece," written and directed by Lakis Lazopoulos,
Greece's top satirist.
</P>
<P>
Lazopoulos asks innocently at each show: "If a newcomer to Athens saw Andreas
and Dimitra walking and holding hands, what would he think?"
</P>
<P>
"That there's a nice girl helping an old man cross the street," comes the
answer.
</P>
<P>
Outside the Vembo Theater a giant poster of Papandreou and Liani embracing
advertises "Little Dimitra's Sweetheart," a take-off of a classic Greek
folklore play, "The Little Shepherdess's Sweetheart."
</P>
<P>
In the show, an Athens housewife is asked whether the prime minister's
pre-election pledges of political and social change have been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
"Andreas has made one change OK. He changed his American woman for a Greek,"
she answers as the audience breaks into enthusiastic applause.
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, Papandreou said he will divorce his 66-year-old American-born
wife Margaret, but no proceedings have yet been started. The blonde Liani has
been divorced twice.
</P>
<P>
Six political revues are playing over the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
According to box-office figures, the shows are grossing up to $37,500 a week,
twice as much as the most successful drama in Athens.

ARE YOU ALLERGIC TO YOUR WORK? SOME FOLKS ARE, DOCTORS SAY

 What job hazard might a baker, dentist and bartender share? Exposure to
allergens that make them sneeze, wheeze or break out in a rash.
</P>
<P>
When choosing careers, few people consider whether they may be allergic to
materials found at the workplace. But many on-the-job substances -- ranging
from rubber gloves to celery -- can trigger allergic reactions that make
workers' lives uncomfortable, if not downright miserable.
</P>
<P>
"Work-related allergies are often misdiagnosed. Only in the last 10 years have
they started to be taken seriously," Dr. Robert Adams, a dermatology professor
at Stanford University, said at a recent seminar.
</P>
<P>
Among the workers at particular risk for developing job-linked allergies are
bakers. The problem is so widespread that wheezing caused by allergic reactions
to flour and other baking ingredients has been dubbed "baker's asthma."
</P>
<P>
In addition to breathing difficulties, Adams said, bakers may develop skin
rashes from exposure to dough, molasses, preservatives and certain flavorings
and spices, particularly cinnamon.
</P>
<P>
Although not all skin problems stem from allergies, many do. That is
significant in light of federal findings that skin disorders account for a
third of all cases of chronic occupational disease. The annual cost of lost
work time, medical care and disability payments related to skin disorders is
estimated to be at least $222 million.
</P>
<P>
Bartenders often are plagued by the allergic skin reactions "extremely common
among people who do wet work," Adams said. Possible allergens for those who
earn their living mixing drinks are lemon juice, aromatic bitters, glass
cleaner and rubber gloves.
</P>
<P>
Rubber gloves are an allergy source for a wide variety of workers, including
doctors, dentists, butchers, dairymen and kitchen employees. The threat of
acquired immune deficiency syndrome and hepatitis has also prompted paramedics,
firefighters and police officers to don gloves.
</P>
<P>
"A common reaction (to rubber gloves) is a hive-like condition on the hands
known as contact urticaria, which causes severe itching," said Adams, noting
that hypo-allergenic and plastic gloves are available for people sensitive to
chemicals in regular gloves.
</P>
<P>
Even people who work in office environments cannot evade job-related allergies.
</P>
<P>
University of Iowa doctors recently reported cases of clerical workers
developing potentially life-threatening allergic reactions to carbonless copy
paper. The researchers found that the resin used in such paper can trigger
rashes, shortness of breath and swelling of the throat.
</P>
<P>
Allergens also lurk in the florist's shop. The American Academy of Dermatology
reports that alstroemeria, a bell-shaped flower commonly used in arrangements
because it stays fresh so long, can cause severe, disabling skin reactions in
floral workers. The ever-popular primrose can also cause rashes.

A test that tells a woman when she can have sex without using artificial birth
control to avoid pregnancy has been developed by a biotechnology company that
said it will be at least a year before it gains regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
Monoclonal Antibodies of Mountain View, Calif., has released details about the
test, which it said provides valid results only during the second half of a
woman's monthly cycle, after ovulation.
</P>
<P>
The test, which Monoclonal said will sell for $3 to $5 per test when it is
eventually marketed, measures progesterone levels to tell women when ovulation
has happened. When the hormone level is high, it indicates that ovulation has
taken place and conception is no longer possible. The test involves putting a
spot of urine on a pad. If the progesterone level is high, the sample shows no
color. If the test sample turns blue, a woman would be liable to become
pregnant.

TREATMENT EFFECTIVE AGAINST BREAST CANCER

The combined results of 61 studies involving nearly 29,000 women establish
"beyond reasonable doubt" that drug and hormone treatment after surgery can
save the lives of many victims of early breast cancer, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
The analysis shows that during the five years after treatment begins, a
synthetic hormone called tamoxifen reduces the odds of death among older women
by about one-fifth. For women under age 50, a combination of chemotherapy drugs
reduces the odds by about one-quarter.
</P>
<P>
Dr. I. Craig Henderson of the Dana-Farber Cancer Center in Boston, one of 79
co-authors of the report last week's New England Journal of Medicine, said that
the treatments do not necessarily cure these women but "substantially delay
death."
</P>
<P>
National Institutes of Health recommended in 1985 that tamoxifen and
chemotherapy be used for breast cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes. In
May, 1988, the National Cancer Institute told doctors that this treatment could
be extended to women in the earliest stages of breast cancer that is not yet
evident in the lymph nodes. The institute based its recommendation on three
unpublished studies showing that cancer was slower to return when these women
were treated after surgery.

In an effort to allay public fear that medical residents are working too many
hours and providing inadequate patient care in hospitals, an ad hoc committee
organized by the University of California has recommended that the state's five
public and three private medical schools restrict doctors in training to no
more than 84 hours of work per week. The recommendations are in stark contrast
to current practices of allowing young physicians, particularly obstetricians
and surgeons, to work round the clock without sleep for upwards of 90 or 100
hours a week.
</P>
<P>
The California plan for reform, however, is in keeping with those of a number
of other efforts around the country to make medical residency training less
stressful and to improve hospital care of patients.
</P>
<P>
The problem for California, and one the UC committee did not address, is how to
pay for the additional personnel that would be needed to implement such a plan.
According to the committee's own estimates, to replace residents with
additional residents, nurses, or trained physicians could cost anywhere from
$26 million to $190 million a year.

<P>
What Napoleon learned in Russia, another macho little general named Jerry
Glanville learned again on the steppes of the Niagara Frontier:
</P>
<P>
It's tough out here in winter.
</P>
<P>
Where was the old Oiler fire?
</P>
<P>
Those high elbows?
</P>
<P>
Those late hits?
</P>
<P>
Maybe that twin bill they just split on the tundra of Cleveland took it out of
them? At any rate, it was a subdued Oiler team that showed up here Sunday and
lost, 17-10, to the Bills in a ho-hum American Football Conference semifinal.
</P>
<P>
The Bills advance to next week's AFC final at Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
The Oilers? Once again, they're the contender that came in from the cold.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately a very good football team isn't going to play anymore," said
Glanville, his voice little more than a whisper.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, his very good football team lost a late season game at home to
the Pittsburgh Steelers, blew a 23-7 lead at Cleveland in the regular-season
finale and lost its chance to welcome the playoffs to the House of Pain.
</P>
<P>
Even so, the Oilers upset the Browns last week and were competing on even terms
Sunday until another of their vintage flourishes backfired. Last season in
Denver, it was Stagger Lee, the lateral pass they threw into the end zone that
became a game-turning fumble. Sunday, it was a third-quarter option on third
and 1 at the Buffalo 2-yard line in a 7-3 game that became a wild pitchout . .
. and then a missed field-goal try.
</P>
<P>
"Well," said Glanville softly, "we felt it would score.
</P>
<P>
"We sent a guy in motion, they followed him and they had one guy to take two.
That's what we wanted."
</P>
<P>
The question, as always, remains, if the Oilers are so big and talented, why
not just forget about the tricks and play football?
</P>
<P>
"The option has been very good for us," Glanville said. "It's what we do down
there. It's how we score."
</P>
<P>
Yeah, well, win some, lose some. The Oilers played last week, and the Bills
rested . . . and plotted.
</P>
<P>
Had the Bills been going backward for a month?
</P>
<P>
Losing three of their last four?
</P>
<P>
Getting out-rushed in three of their last four?
</P>
<P>
Sunday -- surprise! -- the arch-conservative Marv Levy let his hamstrung
prodigy, Jim Kelly, come out firing and Kelly's pulse danced.
</P>
<P>
The Bills passed on 15 of their first 21 first downs . . . and Kelly went 11
for 15.
</P>
<P>
Was Kelly happy, or what?
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah, definitely," he said. "I was a throwing quarterback coming out of the
USFL. I love to throw the ball. That's why I'm a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
"At times during the season, we ran the ball extremely well, so we didn't throw
it. Our defense played so well, our offense kind of took a back seat, but we
were No. 4 in total offense. I think that speaks for itself."
</P>
<P>
However, Levy was having a little trouble himself, guessing right on calls near
the Oiler goal.
</P>
<P>
It was 0-0 when Kelly talked him into going on fourth and 1 at the Houston 3 in
the first period.
</P>
<P>
Kelly threw an incomplete pass.
</P>
<P>
Levy and Kelly were going to guess wrong again later, but not before the Bills
took the lead. Early in the second period, Leonard Smith blocked an Oiler punt
by Greg Montgomery and the Bills took over at the Oiler 46.
</P>
<P>
Kelly promptly threw a couple of first-down passes to Trumaine Johnson for 18
and 9 yards. Then Thurman Thomas broke free over the right side for 16 to the
Oiler 3. A couple of plays later, Robb Riddick jammed over from the 1 -- after
Kelly fell down handing off and Riddick bobbled the ball and guard Jim Ritcher
blocked Eugene Seale, who had stacked up Riddick at the goal line.
</P>
<P>
The Bills were still clinging to a 7-3 lead when Kelly came out firing in the
second half . . . and drilled one into the chest of Oiler nickel back Tracey
Eaton at the Buffalo 47.
</P>
<P>
Moments later, the Oilers were at the Buffalo 2, with third and 1.
</P>
<P>
Where to run?
</P>
<P>
Off the left side behind 320-pound Bruce Davis and Pro Bowl choice Mike
Munchak?
</P>
<P>
Off the right behind Pro Bowl selection Bruce Matthews and blue-chip No. 1 pick
Dean Steinkuhler?
</P>
<P>
How about around right end, where quarterback Warren Moon would have to make a
read, risk injury if he turned it up, or get the ball out to his trailing back,
Mike Rozier?
</P>
<P>
The Oilers chose the option. Moon may have made a bad read, and he certainly
made a bad pitchout. Rozier never touched it, and it rolled over the sideline
for a 12-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
Tony Zendejas then came out to try a 31-yard field goal . . . and duck-hooked
it, and the Oilers had nothing to show for the trip.
</P>
<P>
"It kinda slipped out of my hand and got away from me," Moon said.
</P>
<P>
"It was a matter of either me taking it into the end zone or Mike. I'm not
sure, they said from upstairs that I might have made it myself. I didn't think
I could."
</P>
<P>
Why not run straight ahead?
</P>
<P>
"Well, I've got 5 TDs running the option this year," Moon said, "and our backs
have scored more. We're going to do the things that got us here. We can't throw
it out now."
</P>
<P>
The Oilers use a lot of the old USFL: Houston Gamblers/Jim Kelly/Mouse Davis
run 'n' shoot, and the option, too, which may be imaginative of them. The
argument against the latter, on the pro level, is that defenses will try to
take out your quarterback, and if they do, it won't be worth it.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Moon threw for 195 yards in the first half, and 45 in the second. Why?
He had come into the game with a sore right elbow and injured it again --
running an option.
</P>
<P>
Let's just say that when Zendejas missed, the air went out of the Oilers with a
whoosh you could hear on the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
Each defense held twice.
</P>
<P>
The Bills then put together a 59-yard drive, including Kelly's first-down pass
to Chris Burkett for 26 yards, and a third-down Kelly scramble with a face-mask
penalty against ex-Raider Sean Jones tacked on. Thomas bolted the last 11 yards
off the right side, and it was 14-3.
</P>
<P>
It could have been 17-3 early in the fourth period after Kelly completed a
53-yard pass play to Andre Reed. However, Kelly talked Levy into trying to go
again on fourth and 1 at the 1, and Riddick was thrown back, again.
</P>
<P>
"Heck, it's the playoffs, let's go for it," Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
"I said that to him twice, and we came up short twice. The second time, I
apologized to him."
</P>
<P>
They didn't have to worry, this wasn't the Oilers' day. Moon promptly threw an
interception to Mark Kelso, who returned it 28 yards to the Houston 18.
</P>
<P>
This time, when the Bills got to fourth and 1 at the Houston 9, Levy sent out
his field goal unit. Scott Norwood kicked the 27-yarder and it was, finally,
17-3.
</P>
<P>
Did the Oilers have anything left? Moon took them 80 yards, completing passes
for 65 yards of the drive. Rozier ran straight ahead this time and went over
from the 1 with 5:12 left, making it 17-10.
</P>
<P>
The Oilers even got the ball back . . . briefly.
</P>
<P>
They forced a punt, but Curtis Duncan came running up to field a line drive by
John Kidd, bobbled the ball, went to one knee, got up and tried to run before
he was hit by ex-Oiler Steve Tasker and fumbled the ball to the Bills.
</P>
<P>
The Bills ran out the clock as the fans sang and threw their last snowballs at
the Oilers and the police on horseback, 22 years of pent-up yearnings fulfilled
at last. The Bills hadn't played a home playoff game since 1966, when the
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development-designate, Jack Kemp, who was
watching upstairs, was the quarterback, and they were teeing it up in a
downtown pile of bricks called War Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
In Jerry Glanville's heart, it may have been wintertime, but it's summer in
Buffalo.

QUARTERBACK HAS BIG DAY; 49ERS ROUT VIKINGS, 34-9

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year after suffering his most painful pull outside of a dentist's office,
quarterback Joe Montana was removed from the starting lineup again Sunday, sent
to the bench with 8 minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
Same place, same playoff opponent, same stakes. But hardly the same ol' Joe.
</P>
<P>
This time, the 32-year-old Montana left as conquering hero, having played a
game with the hunger of a man who hadn't thrown a playoff touchdown pass in 4
years.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Montana hadn't.
</P>
<P>
But those ghosts, along with others, were finally purged from the souls of the
San Francisco 49ers, who snapped a 3-year, first-game playoff losing streak
with a 34-9 win over the Minnesota Vikings to advance to next week's NFC title
game against the Chicago Bears.
</P>
<P>
Montana, who would throw his first postseason scoring pass since Super Bowl
XIX, played brilliantly early and made it stand up. Montana finished with
scoring passes of 2, 4 and 11 yards -- all to receiver Jerry Rice, all in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
A more complete reversal of last season's loss to the Vikings is difficult to
imagine.
</P>
<P>
It was here at Candlestick Park that Montana was breaded and deep fried in a
playoff loss a season ago, a humbling performance that led to his second-half
benching and the dawning of a new-age quarterback controversy with Steve Young.
</P>
<P>
Sunday, before a crowd of 61,848, Montana left the game only after his work was
done, his good name and a game's outcome having long been satisfied.
</P>
<P>
And it's not that the 49ers were sensitive about their little run of bad luck
in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
"The past 3 years have been glorious years," Coach Bill Walsh said, responding
to a pointed question afterward. "I don't know where you're from. We've been to
the playoffs every year. We haven't won the Super Bowl in 4 years. People will
look at the negative side about that. But what other team has done more than we
have? We have no apologies for anyone."
</P>
<P>
Especially not after Sunday, when the 49ers reversed virtually every trend from
last season's Vikings loss.
</P>
<P>
None was more important than the elimination of Anthony Carter from the
Vikings' game plan. Last time, Carter cut through the 49er secondary for a
playoff-record 227 yards with 10 catches. Sunday, Carter did not have ball
thrown his direction in the first half.
</P>
<P>
He made his first catch with 13:21 left in the third quarter and finished with
3 catches for 45 yards. Viking quarterback Wade Wilson threw Carter's way just
5 times all day.
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Tim McKyer, who admitted he and the boys did a pretty nice
double-coverage blanket job on Carter, still couldn't believe the Vikings
didn't take a chance on their home-run king.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what their game plan was," McKyer said. "But I know if I was the
coach, I would throw him the ball."
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, for example, don't seem to mind how many people are covering Rice.
Great receivers make great catches, they figure.
</P>
<P>
Carter, of course, has been through this before with his coaching staff and
wasn't pleased with his snubbing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Viking Coach Jerry Burns said the 49ers' heavy pass rush and double coverage
took Carter out of the game.
</P>
<P>
"They didn't do anything differently," Burns snapped later. "They just did it a
hell of a lot better."
</P>
<P>
Carter basically said that Burns took him out of the game. And for Carter,
those lonely pass routes were tough pills to swallow.
</P>
<P>
Double coverage?
</P>
<P>
"That's not what I saw," he said. "I saw a lot of zone. They just didn't call
my number."
</P>
<P>
Today, Viking coaches can reach Carter at home.
</P>
<P>
It was true, though, the 49ers' defensive front put an excessive amount of heat
on Wilson, who sometimes had trouble getting the ball out of his own hand, let
alone to his receivers. Wilson was sacked 6 times on the day for minus-47
yards.
</P>
<P>
"Even if we didn't sack him today, we wanted to be in his face and get a hand
up," 49er defensive end Larry Roberts said. "By keeping a lot of pressure on
Wilson and playing AC (Carter) up tight, we knew we pretty much had them where
we wanted them."
</P>
<P>
And that, of course, was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
On the flip side, San Francisco's offensive line protected Montana well, much
better than last season when the Vikings sacked him 4 times. Sunday, Montana
was sacked once.
</P>
<P>
Against the likes of Keith Millard and Chris Doleman and the rest of
Minnesota's No. 1-ranked defense, that was big news.
</P>
<P>
"Our offensive line had a great day," Montana said.
</P>
<P>
Defensive tackle Millard, twice called for offsides, grew more frustrated as
the day wore on. After Roger Craig's 4-yard run put the 49ers up, 28-9, with
13:41 left, Millard sauntered over and took a shot at Montana's jaw.
</P>
<P>
Montana, certainly not foolish enough to exchange blows, instead wagged his
finger at Millard as he ran off the field. Millard, of course, wagged back.
</P>
<P>
"It was just the heat-of-the-moment-type thing," Montana said. "I was just
congratulating my offensive line and got an elbow across my face."
</P>
<P>
In the end, Millard's face was stained only with egg.
</P>
<P>
Montana, whose mobility this season has been hampered by various injuries,
seemed strong and sharp Sunday, especially in the first half, when he completed
11 of 14 passes for 111 yards.
</P>
<P>
Things might have been worse had the Vikings not squandered a nice 6-minute,
12-play drive on their opening drive, settling for a 47-yard Chuck Nelson field
goal. Minnesota's only lead of the day, 3-0, would last just minutes.
</P>
<P>
Montana drove the 49ers 48 yards late in the quarter before finding Rice open
for a 2-yard scoring pass.
</P>
<P>
Nine seconds later, 49er safety Ronnie Lott intercepted a Wilson pass intended
for Darrin Nelson, returning it 5 yards to the Minnesota 30.
</P>
<P>
A 21-yard reverse run by Rice took it down to the 9, setting up a 4-yard
touchdown pass play, Montana to Rice.
</P>
<P>
Late in the half, after the 49ers had driven 59 yards down to the 11, Montana
faked right and looked left to Rice, who froze Viking corner Reggie Rutland
with an inside move. Rice went outside. Touchdown and 21-3.
</P>
<P>
The Vikings only made a game of it twice. On their first possession of the
third quarter, they finally discovered Carter hit him twice on pass plays of 21
and 14 yards to set up a 5-yard scoring pass from Wilson to Hassan Jones.
Nelson missed the extra point, cutting the lead to 21-9.
</P>
<P>
The play that turned the game came with 2:26 left in the third quarter.
Rutland, anticipating a Montana pass to Rice in the left flat, cut in front of
the receiver at his own 40 and seemed in perfect position to make the
interception and take it 60 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
"We both had the ball in our hands," Rutland said, describing the play. "We
came down with it."
</P>
<P>
The ball, in fact, went past Rutland's fingertips into the hands of Rice, who
turned it into a 28-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
In last season's game, Rutland took a similar gamble and returned a Montana
interception 45 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
As Rutland would say, there were many things different about this game.
</P>
<P>
"It could have went either way," Rutland said. "In another situation, it might
have been different. I'd play it the same way each time. I'd just come down
with it each time."
</P>
<P>
Instead of a 21-16 game, Rice's catch set up the touchdown that put the 49ers
up, 28-9.
</P>
<P>
Roger Craig removed all comeback doubts when he turned a simple pitch into an
80-yard touchdown run with 9:04 left. It was the longest run of Craig's career
and the longest day in recent Viking memory.
</P>
<P>
"Believe it or not, that run was by design," Walsh said of Craig's run. "It
broke like we had hoped. But after the first 5 yards, it was all Roger."
</P>
<P>
Craig, who had been mostly frustrated until his big run, finished with 135
yards in 21 carries.
</P>
<P>
Young replaced Montana with 7:46 remaining. Redemption was sweet, Montana would
say. And complete.

<P>
SCHEMBECHLER COULD USE LAST LAUGH AGAINST USC

<P>
Whenever Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler is reminded of his 1-7 record in the
Rose Bowl, which is often, he jokes about it.
</P>
<P>
It's a logical response, because he can't do anything now about what has
happened in the past.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of his lighthearted comments, Schembechler would like to start
chipping away at his record by beating USC today in the 75th renewal of the
Rose Bowl game.
</P>
<P>
USC Coach Larry Smith doesn't have such skeletons rattling in his coaching
closet.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, there is a certain urgency for Smith to win today's game,
considering that his Trojans lost to Michigan State in last year's Rose Bowl
game in his first appearance as a head coach. It would also take some of the
sting out of a regular-season ending loss to Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
That defeat ranks as one of the most disappointing in 100 years of USC
football. If USC (10-1) had won, it would be defending a No. 1 ranking in
college football against Michigan.
</P>
<P>
USC quarterback Rodney Peete has said that it will be a long time before that
defeat is little more than a memory.
</P>
<P>
So how will the Trojans respond? Smith isn't sure. "We won't know until we come
out on the field. We haven't been able to judge ourselves in that situation
because it's the first time we've come off a loss this season," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for Michigan (8-2-1), the Wolverines could be a national championship
contender today if it weren't for early season losses to Notre Dame and Miami
by a total of 3 points.
</P>
<P>
Much has been written that the USC-Michigan matchup is a secondary bowl game,
inasmuch as No. 1-ranked Notre Dame and No. 3 West Virginia will be playing for
the national championship in the Fiesta Bowl at about the same time.
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Schembechler and Smith contend that the "Granddaddy of them
all," the Rose Bowl, doesn't take a back seat in viewing interest to any bowl.
Subsequent television ratings will provide more insight.
</P>
<P>
In any event, today's Rose Bowl game has its intrinsic interest --
Schembechler's albatross-like record along with the Big Ten's failure here in
recent years, losing 12 of the past 14 Rose Bowl games.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there's the relationship between the coaches. Smith got his coaching
start as a member of Schembechler's staff at Miami of Ohio and Michigan in the
late 1960s and early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
They've been friends ever since, and Smith attributes much of his coaching
philosophy to his early apprenticeship under Schembechler.
</P>
<P>
Smith has lost only 5 games and won 18 in 2 seasons at USC. In those losses,
Trojan turnovers were decisive. Smith says they will be a key factor today.
</P>
<P>
Michigan isn't likely to oblige, considering that quarterbacks Michael Taylor
and Demetrius Brown have thrown only 2 interceptions and have lost only 8
fumbles the entire season.
</P>
<P>
With the notable exception of the Notre Dame game when USC had 4 turnovers, the
Trojans haven't been error-prone.
</P>
<P>
Peete has thrown 10 interceptions, but that's misleading, considering his
entire offensive output. He has completed 208 of 338 passes (61.5%) for an
average of 241.3 yards a game and 18 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Michigan's quarterbacks have attempted only 191 passes. The
Wolverines are primarily a running team, featuring tailback Tony Boles and
fullback Leroy Hoard, who are each averaging 5.5 yards a carry.
</P>
<P>
"Michigan will not be taken out of its running game," Smith said. "They're
better at it than any team we've played."
</P>
<P>
However, the Wolverines may be forced to pass more often than in previous games
considering the Trojans are No. 2-ranked nationally in rushing defense,
allowing an average of only 76.6 yards a game.
</P>
<P>
USC has a more balanced offense, averaging 214.6 yards running and 247 yards
passing compared with 256.6 and 153.4 for Michigan.
</P>
<P>
Both teams have what Smith calls bend-but-not-break defenses. Michigan features
one of the nation's best defensive linemen in tackle Mark Messner.
</P>
<P>
However, Peete, who placed second to Oklahoma State's Barry Sanders in the
Heisman Trophy voting, seemingly provides USC with an edge in an otherwise even
matchup.
</P>
<P>
Brown became the starting quarterback when Taylor suffered a broken collarbone
in the ninth game of the season against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
Brown had 16 interceptions last season, a factor in losing his starting job to
Taylor. However, he hasn't been intercepted since replacing Taylor, completing
61.7% of his passes for 5 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
It's Brown's show today as Taylor was recently hospitalized with the flu and
isn't expected to play.
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines are aware of Peete's capabilities. Said Messner: "He's very,
very fast and he can beat you single-handedly."
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame had some success blitzing Peete in a 27-10 victory, and it wouldn't
be surprising if Michigan uses the same tactic.
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines don't seem to be up-tight, perhaps reflecting the mood of their
coach, who has been accommodating and apparently relaxed since the team's
arrival here.
</P>
<P>
As for his 1-7 Rose Bowl record, Schembechler, who has won more games than any
other active college coach, dismisses it by saying:
</P>
<P>
"If you win all the time, maybe you don't have as much appreciation for it. The
thing that has balanced out my career is the fact I haven't been as successful
in bowls.
</P>
<P>
"If I had the same record I had in bowls as I do in the regular season, I'd
probably be too cocky and have too big an ego."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rose Bowl Notes
</P>
<P>
Kickoff for today's game is 2 p.m. A crowd of 95,000 to 100,000 is expected. .
. . USC is a 6 1/2-point favorite. Even though Aaron Emanuel has been USC's
most productive tailback in recent games, Coach Larry Smith said that Ricky
Ervins would start today. "He has had excellent practices," Smith said of
Ervins, "but all of our tailbacks will play." He was mainly referring to
Ervins, Emanuel and Scott Lockwood. Smith would also like to use Steven Webster
if possible. Webster, a senior, has missed virtually the entire season with
injuries. . . . Michigan's Wilbur Odom, a sophomore, who has played in only one
game, will back up Demetrius Brown at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
USC is ranked fifth in the polls, Michigan 11th. . . . Smith concedes that
Michigan has an edge over USC in the kicking game. Mike Gillette, a catcher on
the baseball team, is averaging 40.4 yards on punts. He set a school record
with his 56-yard field goal against Ohio State. USC punter Chris Sperle is
averaging 38.3 yards, and Quin Rodriguez made 14 of 19 field goals, 7 for 7
inside the 30-yard line. . . . Erik Affholter, USC's All-American split end,
set schools records in the regular season for receptions in a season (63) and
career (118). Michigan has accomplished wide receivers in Greg McMurtry, Chris
Calloway and John Kolesar. However, that group has had a total of only 67
receptions on a run-oriented team.
</P>
<P>
T.J. Osman, Michigan's middle guard, on Bo Schembechler's overall 4-11 bowl
record: "He told us before we left that if we got a question about his bowl
record to answer by saying that it's his record and not anything that we had to
do with." . . . Asked to comment on Michigan allowing 31 points against Ohio
State in the second half of a final regular-season game, defensive tackle Mark
Messner said: "We're still asking what happened. We had the same players and we
were calling the same defenses, but they were going right through us." Michigan
won, though, 34-31, on a late, 41-yard pass from Brown to Kolesar. Michigan is
ranked ninth nationally in scoring defense, allowing an average of 13.9 points
a game. . . . USC has a 3-1 record against Michigan in the Rose Bowl and 3-3
overall. The Trojans have an 18-7 Rose Bowl record. . . . Schembechler has lost
only one Rose Bowl game by more than 8 points, a 24-14 loss to UCLA in 1983.

BOWL RECORD PROVIDES INCENTIVE FOR UCLA

<P>
Unable to beat Washington State to maintain its No. 1 ranking, or to beat USC
to earn a trip to the Rose Bowl, UCLA can still make 1988 a noteworthy season
by beating Arkansas today in the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
Outscoring the eighth-ranked Razorbacks, who were 10-0 before losing their
regular-season finale to Miami, would give the Bruins bowl victories in seven
consecutive seasons, a National Collegiate Athletic Assn. record.
</P>
<P>
Coach Terry Donahue has dangled the record as incentive for his ninth-ranked
Bruins, who were No. 1 for 2 weeks in October before staggering through the
final month of the season, losing 2 of 4 games to finish 9-2.
</P>
<P>
"In my eyes now, the fact that the national championship slipped away, the fact
that we aren't the conference champion, the season is nowhere near as
successful as I had hoped it would be, based on my expectations as they built
throughout the season," Donahue said. "The emotions of the moment tell me that
we've got to win this game or the season's a failure."
</P>
<P>
And beating Arkansas, Donahue said, will not be easy, in spite of the opinions
of the oddsmakers, who favor UCLA.
</P>
<P>
"We've got a lot of obstacles to overcome," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Donahue, the Razorbacks have several psychological advantages.
Donahue seems to say that about every opponent, of course, but in this case he
seems to harbor legitimate concerns.
</P>
<P>
Among them:
</P>
<P>
 -- Arkansas has worked toward this day since 1976, when it beat Georgia in its
last Cotton Bowl appearance, whereas UCLA accepted a bid as the first team from
the West Coast to appear in the Cotton Bowl since 1949 only as a consolation
prize after losing a Rose Bowl showdown to USC, 31-22.
</P>
<P>
 -- Arkansas might be inspired by a natural resentment toward UCLA's
All-American quarterback, Troy Aikman, who has received most of the attention
from fans and the local media because the Dallas Cowboys are expected to make
him the No. 1 pick next April in the National Football League draft.
</P>
<P>
 -- A majority of the fans in the sold-out, 72,032-seat Cotton Bowl stadium
will wear funny red hats shaped like hogs' heads. Whereas about 35,000 tickets
to the game were sold in Arkansas, fewer than 3,000 were sold at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
 -- Arkansas might simply be better than advertised. The Razorbacks, some
believe, were underrated, never rising above eighth in the national rankings.
The Southwest Conference champions, in fact, earned more respect from their
loss to Miami than they did from their 10 victories. And they might have beaten
the second-ranked Hurricanes if safety Steve Atwater hadn't dropped a potential
interception in the Arkansas end zone with fewer than 6 minutes to play.
Miami's Carlos Huerta then kicked a 20-yard field goal with 5:38 left to give
the Hurricanes an 18-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
"We have a great opportunity here," Donahue said. "I think the obstacles and
the barriers for this game are a great deal different and more challenging than
some we've had in past (bowl) games."
</P>
<P>
UCLA, though, isn't the only one facing hurdles.
</P>
<P>
Even before Arkansas arrived in Dallas last week, Coach Ken Hatfield had
suspended, for unspecified reasons, All-Southwest Conference offensive guard
Freddie Childress and defensive tackle Wayne Martin, an All-American and the
defensive player of the year in the Southwest Conference.
</P>
<P>
Neither will play today.
</P>
<P>
Also, the Razorbacks have had to deal with speculation about Hatfield, who
reportedly is among the candidates to replace Vince Dooley at Georgia.
</P>
<P>
"After the game, we'll decide about the future," said Hatfield, who has
sidestepped all questions about his plans.
</P>
<P>
And the Razorbacks, despite their record, were hardly a dominant team, winning
6 games by 8 points or less, including a 21-14 victory over 0-11 Rice.
</P>
<P>
"We were just about one step better than everybody we played and then we got to
Miami and were about one step behind," Hatfield said.
</P>
<P>
Directed by quarterback Quinn Grovey, who led the Southwest Conference in
passing efficiency but passed for only 966 yards and 4 touchdowns, the
Razorbacks' flexbone attack ranked third in the SWC in total offense.
</P>
<P>
The Razorbacks also ranked third in total defense.
</P>
<P>
UCLA, meanwhile, caught the nation's attention with its 41-28 dismantling of
Nebraska in September, moved to No. 1 after Notre Dame knocked off Miami in
October and rolled to a 7-0 start, its best in 22 years, before squandering a
27-6 third-quarter lead in a 34-30 loss to Washington State.
</P>
<P>
That was followed by less-than-impressive victories over Oregon and Stanford,
in which Aikman endured his least productive games, and the loss to USC, in
which Aikman was brilliant, throwing for 317 yards and 2 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
Still, Hatfield said that UCLA was more balanced offensively than Miami and
called the Bruins "as good a team as there is in the country."
</P>
<P>
Unless they beat Arkansas, though, their season will be looked upon in some
circles as a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
"If you can view 9-2 as an unsuccessful season, I'm not sure that I'm not as
guilty as the next person in contributing to the madness," Donahue said. "It
was a good year, but it just didn't meet all of our expectations."
</P>
<P>
A victory over the Razorbacks would ease the burden.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cotton Bowl Notes
</P>
<P>
Of the 4 other schools that won bowl games in 6 consecutive seasons, Georgia
Tech and Alabama had their streaks ended by Southwest Conference schools.
Georgia Tech lost to Arkansas, 14-7, in the 1960 Gator Bowl and Alabama lost to
Texas, 14-12, in the 1982 Cotton Bowl. USC and Nebraska also won bowl games in
6 straight seasons. . . . In the only meeting between the schools, UCLA and
Arkansas played to a 10-10 tie in the 1978 Fiesta Bowl. . . . UCLA is listed as
a 5 1/2-point favorite. . . . The extended forecast called for a cloudy sky
with temperatures in the low 50s and a 20% chance of rain.
</P>
<P>
UCLA is playing in a bowl game for the eighth consecutive season, the longest
current string in the Pacific 10 Conference. Its record in bowl games is 8-7-1,
including a 6-2-1 record under Coach Terry Donahue. . . . Arkansas is 9-12-3 in
bowl games, including a 1-3 record under Coach Ken Hatfield and a 2-3-1 record
in the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
Outside linebacker Eric Smith of UCLA will miss the game with knee and ankle
injuries, Donahue said Sunday, and will be replaced in the starting lineup by
Billy Ray. . . . UCLA also will be without inside linebacker Chance Johnson,
who is out with a knee injury, reserve linebacker Stacy Argo and reserve
defensive back Randy Beverly. . . . Eric Ball, who has been bothered by an
ankle injury, will start at tailback and reserve wide receiver David Keating
might play despite a hamstring injury, Donahue said.
</P>
<P>
Mark Henry will take the place of suspended right guard Freddie Childress in
Arkansas' starting lineup, although James Morris will move over from left guard
to take Childress' regular place in the line. . . . Suspended defensive tackle
Wayne Martin, who led the Razorbacks with 13 sacks, will be replaced by
sophomore Tony Ollison. . . . James Rouse, who was Arkansas' leading rusher
before missing the Razorbacks' last 5 games with a knee injury, is expected to
play, but will not start.

U.S. International University will try for its second consecutive victory
tonight, playing host to Vermont in a men's nonconference basketball game at
7:30 in Golden Hall.
</P>
<P>
USIU beat St. Francis (N.Y.), 95-77, Friday for its second victory in 3 games.
</P>
<P>
Vermont lost, 83-76, to San Diego State Saturday. Vermont (1-5) has lost its
last 5 games.
</P>
<P>
Only one senior will start for either team tonight. The Gulls (5-9) have no
senior starters, while Vermont starts two freshmen and sophomore and junior
forwards.
</P>
<P>
Vermont's one senior starter, 6-foot 11-inch center Joe Calavita, is averaging
16.3 points and 9.6 rebounds and has scored in double figures in 23 consecutive
games, including 20 Saturday against San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
USIU has started 6-11, 235-pound sophomore Mike Sterner at center. Sterner,
however, has had his problems this season and is averaging just 4 points and 4
rebounds. Demetrius Laffitte, a 6-5 forward, leads the team in rebounding with
10 per game. RICK HAZLETINE

AUBURN, FLORIDA STATE HAVE CORNERS COVERED;
</P>
<P>
IT'LL BE TIGERS' DEFENSE AGAINST SEMINOLES' OFFENSE IN TONIGHT'S SUGAR BOWL

<P>
For Auburn's Tigers and Florida State's Seminoles, the ifs are these:
</P>
<P>
If Notre Dame and West Virginia had been upset this season, somewhere along the
line, and if Miami were to be upset today, Auburn and Florida State could be
playing for No. 1 tonight in the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the way they see it, they'll be playing for No. 2, when, at the end of
a long, 7-game day of football, the fourth-ranked Seminoles and seventh-ranked
Tigers meet on the Superdome field at 5:30 p.m. (PST).
</P>
<P>
By then, many sports fans will doubtless be bowled out. But others may still be
wondering what Deion Sanders is all about.
</P>
<P>
The pregame star of the 55th Sugar Bowl, Sanders is the fast-talking,
fast-moving Florida State cornerback who led the nation in punt returns this
season.
</P>
<P>
"When you think of Florida State, you think of Deion Sanders," Auburn
quarterback Reggie Slack said Sunday. "He's the guy who gets them their great
field position (on punt returns).
</P>
<P>
"The first thing (a passer) looks for is where Deion is. If I'm throwing to his
side, I have one goal: Get the ball there quick."
</P>
<P>
Sanders is a three-sport star who played in the New York Yankee chain last
summer shortly after he was named the MVP of the Metro Conference track and
field meet, where he won at 100 and 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
"He's the most exciting athlete we've ever had here," Florida State Coach Bobby
Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
Even so, the Seminoles under Bowden are known for offense.
</P>
<P>
"I can't stand a quarterback who's afraid he might throw an interception,"
Bowden said, tipping his game plan.
</P>
<P>
He added that he also expects a big performance from running back Sammie Smith.
</P>
<P>
Pat Dye's Auburn team, meanwhile, is known for defense. The Tigers led the
nation this season in total defense, scoring defense and run defense.
</P>
<P>
"You only do that if you've got quality (players) everywhere, in every
position," said Auburn's All-American defensive tackle Tracy Rocker, the winner
this season of both the Outland and Lombardi trophies.
</P>
<P>
Florida State quarterback Chip Ferguson said: "People say this game is our
offense against their defensive team. (But) I'm not so sure about that. I've
seen our defense. It's terrific."
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, working with four receivers who alternate by pairs, had a big season,
leading the Seminoles to 10 straight victories after their stunning 31-0 defeat
on opening day at Miami (Fla).
</P>
<P>
Going into the Miami game, Florida State was No. 1 in the polls that Notre Dame
leads today. What happened?
</P>
<P>
"We weren't in the right frame of mind (for Miami)," Bowden said. "We were
highly overconfident -- I was overconfident myself.
</P>
<P>
"We had outplayed (Miami) the year before, and lost by 1 point. We had most of
our team back, and they were remaking theirs. We had been practicing very well
-- and they walloped us."
</P>
<P>
Other Seminoles suggested that Miami may have broken Florida State's audible
code that day.
</P>
<P>
"They read us like a book," one Florida State coach said.
</P>
<P>
Said a Florida State offensive tackle, Joey Ionata, "Every time we called an
audible, (Miami) shifted right into the hole."
</P>
<P>
But it's all over now, and, said Bowden, "The rest of the season has proved how
good we really were then -- and are now."
</P>
<P>
It has also proved how good Auburn is. Under Dye, whose team shared the
Southeastern Conference title this season with LSU, the Tigers have made seven
straight bowl trips.
</P>
<P>
They've been one of the four biggest winners in college football the last 6
years, winning 80% of the time.
</P>
<P>
"We've never had a better defensive player than Tracy Rocker," Dye said. "And
the rest of our defense is about as experienced as you can get. We have two or
three great (defensive) players, and seven or eight others who are playing at
the top of their game."
</P>
<P>
Dye was asked what it would take today to make him identify Auburn as his
best-ever team.
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't take (more than) just a win," he said.

During the 1980s, Clemson has won 5 Atlantic Coast Conference championships and
1 national title. During that span, Oklahoma has won 5 Big Eight championship
and 1 national title.
</P>
<P>
Both teams are 9-2 entering today's Citrus Bowl game. Clemson is ranked 13th,
Oklahoma 10th.
</P>
<P>
Still, Clemson Coach Danny Ford believes this game represents a measuring stick
of sorts for his team.
</P>
<P>
"We're anxious to play the University of Oklahoma because of their tradition,"
Ford said. "We want to play and see where we are. We know where Oklahoma is.
They're there every year."
</P>
<P>
Where Oklahoma is going is on probation. The received National Collegiate
Athletic Assn. sanctions 2 weeks ago, and this will be the Sooners last bowl
game for at least 2 years.
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma Coach Barry Switzer said the sanctions would have no effect on the
game.
</P>
<P>
"That won't be an excuse," he said. "Clemson will have more to do with it than
anything else."
</P>
<P>
Throughout the week, Ford and his players have described the Sooners in glowing
terms. Switzer, for one, doesn't believe the praise is deserved.
</P>
<P>
"We are a good college football team, but we're not anywhere near what we have
been before," Switzer said, alluding to the teams that went 11-1 in each of the
past 3 seasons.
</P>
<P>
Clemson, who lost to Florida State and North Carolina State, comes into the
Citrus Bowl with a 4-game winning streak. The Tigers scored at least 29 points
in each of those games.
</P>
<P>
Rodney Williams directed an I-formation offense that averaged 397 yards per
game, the best in Ford's 10 seasons as coach. The senior quarterback, who has
been named most valuable player in both of his bowl games, doesn't throw often
or well, but he does win. His 31-10-2 record makes him the winningest starter
in ACC history.
</P>
<P>
One reason Williams doesn't throw much is tailback Terry Allen, who became the
first Clemson sophomore to rush for more than 1,000 yards when he ran for 1,139
this season.
</P>
<P>
Clemson prefers to keep the ball on the ground, although Williams burned Penn
State for 214 passing yards in a 35-10 Fiesta Bowl victory last year.
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma finished fourth nationally with an average of 343 yards rushing per
game. However, that was accomplished mostly on artificial turf and with Charles
Thompson at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
When the Sooners take to the grass field of the Citrus Bowl, gimpy-legged
Jamelle Holieway will be the quarterback in his final collegiate game.

TURNOVERS MIGHT PROVE COSTLY TO LSU, SYRACUSE

Coaches from Louisiana State and Syracuse, today's opponents in the Hall of
Fame Bowl, see little difference between their teams.
</P>
<P>
"When you have two teams as evenly matched as we are, the game is going to be
decided by turnovers and big plays," said LSU Coach Mike Archer, whose Tigers
will take an 8-3 record and one of the Southeastern Conference's best passing
attacks into the game.
</P>
<P>
"The game is not going to be decided by whether they throw the ball well or
not. We expect them to throw it well," said Syracuse Coach Dick MacPherson, who
starts 5 fifth-year seniors in a secondary that hasn't given up a touchdown
pass in 38 quarters.
</P>
<P>
"I think the game will be decided by whoever plays the hardest, the cleanest,
and has no turnovers, because we're both excellent football teams."
</P>
<P>
Syracuse (9-2) is ranked 17th going into the second-ever meeting between the
schools. LSU, a 13-10 winner over the Orangemen in the 1965 Sugar Bowl, is No.
16 and a slight underdog despite being co-champions of the SEC in Archer's
second season.
</P>
<P>
"We're confident, we know all about the SEC, and it's a great conference,"
Syracuse quarterback Todd Philcox said. "But we played one of their teams last
year and did pretty well. We're not in awe."
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen, 11-0 during the 1987 regular season, tied Auburn, 16-16, in last
year's Sugar Bowl when the Tigers settled for a game-tying field goal with 1
second left.
</P>
<P>
This season, the Orangemen won 8 of their last 9 after a 26-9 loss to Ohio
State. The other defeat came at West Virginia, 31-9, Nov. 19.
</P>
<P>
LSU also finished strongly after losing to Ohio State (36-33) and Florida
(19-6). The Tigers began a 5-game winning streak with a 7-6 victory over Auburn
and closed with a 30-point rout of Tulane after losing to Miami, 44-3.
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen will play without junior running back Michael Owens, the team's
third-leading rusher with 460 yards. MacPherson suspended him for a "repeated
breach of team guidelines."
</P>
<P>
All-American safety Markus Paul leads a Syracuse defense, which will try to
stop quarterback Tommy Hodson, a 52% passer who threw for 2,074 yards and 13
touchdowns to carry LSU after preseason knee injuries sidelined running back
Harvey Williams and wide receiver Todd Kinchen.

AFTER SUFFERING HEART ATTACK, LEE ELDER NOW ON COURSE ON SENIOR TOUR
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lee Elder is the surprise entry in the senior division of the Tournament of
Champions, which ushers in the professional golf season beginning Thursday at
La Costa.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen months ago, Elder had no intention of playing in this tournament. He
was in a hospital fighting for his life.
</P>
<P>
Only tournament winners qualify for the opening tournament of the season. Elder
climaxed an extraordinary comeback by winning the Gus Machado tournament in
late November. His 6 under 65 on the last round enabled him to win by 5 shots
with a 54-hole total of 202. He had made it back almost a year to the day after
suffering a heart attack that threatened his life.
</P>
<P>
After finishing ninth in the Gus Machado at Key Biscayne, Fla. Nov. 22, 1987,
Elder became ill. He had been on a busy schedule in October and November,
flying coast-to-coast twice and to Japan, competing in tournaments every week.
He had complained of back and side pains during the tournament, wearing a brace
for the last round after leading the first round.
</P>
<P>
"I probably was worn out, but I thought it was a back problem," Elder recalled.
"I never thought about a heart attack. Something like that couldn't happen to
Lee Elder. But it did. By 10 that night I was in terrible pain. I had to go to
the hospital."
</P>
<P>
Elder was in the intensive care heart unit for 5 days and remained in the
hospital another 9 days.
</P>
<P>
"The doctor told me that only extensive tests would determine whether I would
ever play golf again," said Elder, who arrived early in Southern California to
practice for the tournament. "It was frightening. I was only 53 and golf was my
life. I didn't know anything else. There was a chance I would wind up like
Arthur Ashe, unable to compete again.
</P>
<P>
"As it turned out, I was lucky. There was only a small tear in the heart. Tests
indicated there was very little blockage of the arteries. The doctor said being
a golfer, being outside so much and walking, probably kept me from having a
much more severe attack.
</P>
<P>
"Ten days after going to the hospital, my doctor came into the room and said,
'I have some very good news for you. You will be able to play again. It's your
choice. You had a stress cholesterol attack. Rest, time, no stress and
rehabilitation are the answer. It's up to you.' "
</P>
<P>
It meant a complete change in life style. He had to give up smoking, decrease
his drinking, go on a low cholesterol diet and take cardiovascular treatment
daily.
</P>
<P>
"I had been a heart attack waiting to happen," he said. "I smoked two or three
packs of cigarettes a day and I had been drinking heavily. I had very high
cholesterol and wore myself out physically with all that traveling. I ate the
worst possible foods, eggs, fatty meats and lots of it. I let myself get fat.
In addition, I kept my anger inside of me, under control on the course. I
wanted to keep up an image. Of course, there were times in the clubhouse when I
blew my top. I would throw the offending club -- it's always the club's fault
-- around the locker room after a poor round.
</P>
<P>
"I was determined to follow orders and continue my career. Quitting smoking was
easy. I couldn't smoke during the 14 days in the hospital. The diet and the
drinking, except for the holidays, were not too tough, either. I'm on a 1,700
calories per day diet and I haven't had an egg in more than a year. I go to the
cardiovascular treatment center every day and I walk at least 2 miles."
</P>
<P>
When the doctor told Elder he could start chipping in January, Elder said he
wanted to play in the Senior PGA, which is played near his Palm Beach Gardens,
Fla. home, and started Feb. 10. He was told he couldn't.
</P>
<P>
"But, he told me I could start swinging a club Jan. 20," Elder said. "He told
me it would probably hurt at first. I was to stop, take a nitroglycerin pill
and try again. It never did hurt at all. The first few days I was afraid to
swing hard, but when I finally did, it still didn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
"When I started hitting golf balls, it was like hitting into a three-club wind.
I had no strength. It wasn't that difficult to adjust, especially with the
irons. I have always been a good iron player."
</P>
<P>
Elder, to the surprise of his doctor, played in the Senior PGA. He amazed
everyone by shooting a 70 in the first round. Although he faded somewhat, he
still earned $7,000.
</P>
<P>
"I knew I still had a long way to go," he said. "Probably a year. At first, I
would play a tournament and rest one week. In warm weather I could play two in
a row.
</P>
<P>
"Guys I used to outdrive were now hitting the ball farther than I could. I
wanted to do some weightlifting to regain my strength, but the doctor wouldn't
let me. However, I was allowed to use 3-pound weights when I went for my walk.
</P>
<P>
"The change was gradual. My caddy has been with me 8 years and when I
practiced, he would measure off the distance I hit with each club. But, I could
tell by the way I felt that I was hitting the ball better."
</P>
<P>
By late summer, Elder was playing regularly again and challenged in a couple of
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
"I would have felt good if I never shot better than 80," he said. "It was
wonderful just competing again. It was a real bonus when I won the tournament."
</P>
<P>
The victory put Elder in select company. He is one of nine pros to win $1
million on the Regular PGA tour and also on the Senior tour.
</P>
<P>
Elder was the first black golfer to play in the Masters. He was the first to
make the Ryder Cup team, and the first to win a million on each tour. But he
doesn't consider himself a pioneer.
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no," he said. "I had it easy. Charlie Sifford, Pete Brown and Rafe Botts.
They took most of the knocks. They did the fighting. They were the ones not
allowed to even dress in the clubhouse. I experienced some things, but it keeps
getting better. I'm just trying to make it easier for those who will come along
after me.
</P>
<P>
"The worst experience was at the Masters in 1975. I was always on stage.
Everybody wanted to know how it felt. And some wondered, 'Is he a gentleman?' I
was a little bit better than the caddies.
</P>
<P>
"In the week we (his wife Rose) were at the Masters, we had to change houses
four times. The pressure was unfair. I couldn't think about golf. It was the
first time I was ever happy to miss the cut. The next year Calvin Peete was
there, too, so it was nothing."
</P>
<P>
All the problems in a pro career that began 30 years ago don't seem too
important since the heart attack.
</P>
<P>
"The Lord gave me a second chance and I'm not going to get upset about
anything," Elder said. "Maybe, I do have one little goal. I want to outdrive
those guys again. Maybe this is the week I'll do it."

LAW OF ACADEMICS: 1ST-TERM TRUSTEE JIM ROACHE PROVES FULL OF SURPRISES
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One Thursday last month, Jim Roache popped in unannounced at Pershing Junior
High in San Carlos for a tour, part of his periodic efforts as a San Diego city
school board member to get an unvarnished, grass-roots feel for trends and
complaints.
</P>
<P>
During the school lunch break, Principal Bill Hassett took Roache, who commands
the county sheriff's substation in Lemon Grove, to chat with three math
teachers eating in the no-smoking lounge. Roache immediately engaged the three
in a lively discussion about the school district's new common core curriculum,
an idea he co-sponsored last year. The core, now being phased in, will require
all secondary school students to take college preparatory courses in basic
subject areas, including algebra.
</P>
<P>
The math teachers decried the plan, saying that some students simply cannot be
taught algebra and that to require such classes will bring only further
frustration to teacher and student, and could result in more dropouts.
</P>
<P>
As Roache turned to leave after 20 minutes of animated questions and answers,
one teacher asked him what he did for a living.
</P>
<P>
"I'm in law enforcement," Roache replied, realizing the teacher had no idea he
had been talking to a school board member.
</P>
<P>
"Well, if ever you are with school administrators, you'll find they're the ones
cramming this thing down our throats," the teacher said.
</P>
<P>
"I think maybe I could plead guilty to being part of that," Roache laughed as
he left.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impact Outstrips Recognition
</P>
<P>
The incident is illustrative of the fact that although many San Diegans -- even
within the 11,000-employee school district -- may not recognize first-term
board member Roache by face or name, they are keenly aware of his impact in
changing the shape of local schools.
</P>
<P>
Roache, finishing up only his second year as a school trustee, has surprised
both administrators and fellow board members with his aggressive stance on
reform issues. The many board initiatives under way have helped catapult San
Diego into the forefront of districts nationwide that are experimenting -- at
times with controversy -- with new ways of teaching.
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old Roache has belied the image he brought to the board: that of an
inflexible right-wing ideologue. He is praised for his hard work, his
willingness to listen and his enjoyment of debate without hidden agendas.
Observers say he marks a substantial change in representation for his area in
the the city's northeastern tier. Predecessor Larry Lester was an
often-inflexible conservative member who delighted in staking out extreme
positions.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Roache was elected the board's vice president as a prelude to
becoming president next year.
</P>
<P>
"I think Jim is doing a good job, although he comes from a conservative point
of view," said colleague Kay Davis, the board's senior member, who has had her
share of disagreements with Roache during the past two years, in particular
over core curriculum.
</P>
<P>
"He has very strong opinions, and sometimes he doesn't know everything about an
issue before forming that strong opinion, and then you have to convince him to
look at a different way or conclusion.
</P>
<P>
"But what saves him is that he really is a pragmatist who realizes this is not
a perfect world . . . " she said.
</P>
<P>
District Supt. Tom Payzant said Roache has surprised many people, including
himself.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Game Playing
</P>
<P>
"I guess I thought he would be more ideological and have a stereotypical
conservative agenda, however people wanted to define that, based on the
consensus of what people were expecting," Payzant said.
</P>
<P>
"But I have found him very open-minded, receptive to good data and
well-reasoned argument, and his candor and ability to go to the heart of issues
are very refreshing. Plus he has a good sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
"He has no hidden agendas and does no game playing, and that is commendable in
public policy-making," Payzant said. "We do disagree at times, but he also has
also taken risks and told his community things that they don't necessarily want
to hear. That makes him very effective over the long haul in understanding the
conflict at times between representing the people of his district and the best
interests of students in all of San Diego."
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Smith, who retired last month after eight years on the board
representing heavily minority areas, said Roache has the potential to be the
group's most influential member.
</P>
<P>
In May, 1987, Smith and Roache formed an alliance, considered unusual by some
at the time, to push the core curriculum with colleagues and top administrators
who were initially less than enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
"Despite my own misgivings at first -- I thought he was a little naive -- I
soon found he really cared for kids," Smith said, citing a talk Roache gave at
the dedication of DePortola Middle School in early 1987. "I didn't know what
deep feelings he had for education until I heard him speak that day about
patriotism, about high standards for all children (a longtime priority for
Smith) and how education will affect America's future.
</P>
<P>
"He opened his heart that day, and I was in tears at the end."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knew He'd Be Stereotyped
</P>
<P>
The lean, intense sheriff's captain said he knew he would be stereotyped when
he joined the board. After all, his 1986 election opponent, Sue Braun, had
labled Roache's background as simply "jails, jails, jails" in mocking his
campaign for an education office. Roache won the final vote by a scant 903
ballots.
</P>
<P>
"People said, 'He's a cop, he's a non-educator, he's a white male, and he comes
from a predominantly Caucasian district.' And in their minds, that added up to
a right-wing, red-necked, kick-ass, take-names conservative," Roache said.
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I am a conservative, but to me, that means a value system that at its
base says that education is important to society, and that means my objective
is to have all kids receive the best possible education no matter what color
they are or where they come from."
</P>
<P>
Both his own uneven educational background and his 18 years in law enforcement,
often dealing with school-related problems, have helped bring forth not a
cynical view of society, as many administrators assumed, but rather a sense
that all things are possible.
</P>
<P>
Roache acknowledges that he stayed in high school -- he graduated from
Twentynine Palms High north of Palm Springs -- only because of athletics, and
he dropped out of Grossmont College before joining the Air Force in the
mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
Only after several years of supporting a wife and child on an enlisted man's
sparse salary did Roache realize he needed further education to make more of
his life. He returned to community college and eventually graduated from San
Diego State University.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Key Is Building Blocks
</P>
<P>
"That is why the common core concept has been so important to me," Roache said.
"A lot of kids are like I was, who don't know where they are going, who have no
immediate goals. But at some point in the future, they will develop a plan, and
the key is to give them the fundamental academic building blocks so that they
won't be encumbered by poor basic educational preparation like I was when I
matured.
</P>
<P>
"They'll still have to work hard, but at least they will stand a chance of
making it more quickly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Roache also links the core concept to his years in dealing with juveniles in
trouble with the law.
</P>
<P>
"Look, I'm a blue-collar type of guy, and I make no pretense to be an
intellectual," Roache said. "But when I see a kid picked up for burglary or
whatever, I sometimes talk with them and I see a chance is still there, that
almost no one is beyond salvation and that there is always the chance that
somebody will connect with them to turn them around."
</P>
<P>
In his position as station commander, Roache oversees all contacts between his
officers and public schools in the Grossmont and Lemon Grove school districts,
giving him an additional perspective on school-related issues. Grossmont Union
High School District Supt. Robert Pyle consults periodically with Roache on
issues from violence to drugs.
</P>
<P>
Roache concedes that other San Diego board members, such as Kay Davis, have
questioned his commitment to programs for children identified as gifted or for
advanced placement testing for students ticketed for blue-chip universities.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants Them to Have the Option
</P>
<P>
"I do care about those programs because those children are going to be our
future doctors and physicists," Roache said. "But I am firmly convinced that
the great portion of our future leaders, from clergy to politicians, are going
to be from the vast, amorphous group of regular education kids, and they are
going to end up driving our culture.
</P>
<P>
"I want the common core so that more of these kids will have the options of
being among our future leaders."
</P>
<P>
The hard-charging style with which Roache has approached life admittedly has
clashed with the nature of school board decision making.
</P>
<P>
"I am impatient, I want to see quick results, but I know that on a lot of
issues, the quick fix won't work and that it takes time on long-range, complex
things such as the core," Roache said.
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, I would have liked to have had the core curriculum implemented
everywhere at once. But my philosophy is also to be pragmatic, to take a little
at a time if you can't persuade everyone of the validity of the entire program.
The reality of implementation involves budgets and teachers and administrators,
and I know from my own experience (he oversees 40 people with an annual budget
of $1.5 million) that it must be a group effort. . . . I need to give others
more time to work through things."
</P>
<P>
Roache has staked out clear positions on two major issues expected to come
before the board in 1989: a possible change to district-only elections and the
idea of health clinics at schools.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relishes the Debate
</P>
<P>
On both, he appears opposed to positions of the two new board members, Ann
Armstrong and Shirley Weber, but Roache said he looks forward to honest debate
and, where possible, compromise.
</P>
<P>
Already, Roache arranged for the board to meet in an informal workshop last
month where members could learn about their colleagues' philosophies candidly
and firsthand, rather than relying on media reports as the previous board did
in forming its first impressions of Roache.
</P>
<P>
He cites his own votes on year-round schools as a reason for keeping the
present system of electing school board members, rather than opting for
elections by geographic district only. (Currently, two finalists are nominated
in a primary by voters in their geographic district, but compete in the entire
school district in the final election.) Roache went against the wishes of many
in the upscale, influential Scripps Ranch area in 1987 by supporting Payzant's
recommendation to have the area's elementary school, Jerabek, go year-round on
a four-track schedule to relieve overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
"I realize that some constituents still feel I sold them down the river,"
Roache said. After more than a year of implementation, the year-round schedule
is said to be going smoothly.
</P>
<P>
"But if I voted in opposition, how in good conscience could I tell some other
school or some other community in San Diego to go multi-track year-round? Yet
if we had district-only elections, I don't know how I could risk making such a
vote and not become the target of organized special interests and community
activists, who have great power within districts, at the next election."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controversy Could Erupt
</P>
<P>
On the issue of health clinics, Roache was told last month by Hassett, the
principal at Pershing, that clinics are needed because too many children do not
have regular medical care until their illnesses become crises.
</P>
<P>
"How you do it given the controversy that could erupt, I don't know," Hassett
said, referring to a wrenching board debate that occurred three years ago over
the issue of providing birth control and abortion information. The board voted
3 to 2 against a Payzant plan for the clinics. Roache's predecessor, Lester,
led the battle against them.
</P>
<P>
However, both new members, Weber and Armstrong, favor clinics and, together
with board President Susan Davis, could provide the majority needed to
establish them.
</P>
<P>
"I agree that there is a legitimate need for health care services for
adolescents and youth and it is not being met now," Roache said. "I have
political reservations about whether that is proper for schools, but the
practical side of me says that society is paying a tremendous cost because it
isn't being done elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
"If some program can be designed for those services, I would favor it. But if
you add birth control and abortion aspects, that offends me. I want some
parental contact included when you do that, even though I know a lot of parents
don't talk to their children about (sex-related) matters and that some kids
don't have parents to talk to.
</P>
<P>
"But it just offends me if we don't bring the parent or guardian into the
process on the campus. . . . By not doing so, we are saying we know what is
best for their kid despite any moral or religious values of the family, or that
parents aren't thinking right on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, we are arguing in all our reform efforts that parent support
is vital for the success of school, but we don't want them there when it comes
to pregnancy or sex."
</P>
<P>
Roache said he will work for compromise if both sides are amenable. Despite his
feelings on family planning, he supports programs at several high schools that
allow teen-age mothers to continue their schooling while receiving child care
and birth control information.
</P>
<P>
"You can't just throw the kids out of school," Roache said. "This is a real,
real difficult issue, and we have to avoid the extremism of both sides."

MOTORCYCLE THEFT SUSPECT WOUNDED BY LA MESA POLICE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A La Mesa police officer shot a man in the chest Friday night while police were
attempting to arrest him in Lemon Grove.
</P>
<P>
The victim, identified as James L. Warnicke, 22, of Lemon Grove was listed in
serious condition Sunday at UC San Diego Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
La Mesa police spokeswoman Allison Moore said Officer Jeff Allen followed two
motorcyclists to a Lemon Grove liquor store.
</P>
<P>
Waiting outside, Allen was advised by his radio dispatcher that one of the
motorcycles had been reported stolen. The officer asked for backup assistance
and when other officers arrived, they confronted the two men.
</P>
<P>
Moore said that the officers asked both men to raise their hands, but that
Warnicke "suddenly moved his hands to an object in his waistband." She said the
officers again ordered him to stop, but that Warnicke repeated the movement and
that Allen then fired one shot, hitting Warnicke in the right side of the
chest.
</P>
<P>
Warnicke was taken by Life-flight to the medical center, where he was held on
suspicion of motorcycle theft.
</P>
<P>
His companion, Andre Perez, 26, of La Mesa, was held in the downtown county
jail on suspicion of possessing a dangerous weapon and on several outstanding
warrants.
</P>
<P>
Moore said detectives found a knife at the scene, but she said it was unclear
what, if anything, Warnicke may have had inside his waistband.
</P>
<P>
Allen, a 3-year police veteran, was placed on administrative leave while the
investigation is continuing.

SMOKE FROM RUBBISH FIRE FILLS JAIL
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burning rubbish and debris was placed inside a ventilation system duct at the
federal Metropolitan Correctional Center Sunday afternoon, sending a large
amount of smoke wafting through several levels of the high-rise jail building
downtown, San Diego fire officials reported.
</P>
<P>
Fire Capt. William Middleton said there were no injuries to inmates but the
incident presented some problems for jail officials because smoke was blown
through several stories of the complex. He said the burning material had been
placed inside a duct on the 8th floor.
</P>
<P>
"Other than that, it was a relatively small fire and easy to contain,"
Middleton said.
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported about 2:30 p.m., he said. Because the location was a
high-rise, 24-story structure, the Fire Department sent a large number of units
to the scene, including eight engine companies, four truck companies, a rescue
rig, three battalion chiefs and one division chief.
</P>
<P>
Jail officials declined to comment on the incident.

CONSTRUCTIVE DISSENT;
</P>
<P>
A TOPANGA-BASED GROUP IS OPPOSING U.S. POLICY BY HELPING NICARAGUANS WITH
BUILDING PROJECTS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ted Heselton is, in effect, a contra Contra. The 40-year-old West
Kennebunkport, Me., carpenter and Vietnam veteran spent 6 weeks in war-torn
Nicaragua in 1987 helping build houses, a school and a water system in a poor
rural cooperative.
</P>
<P>
"I was frustrated with demonstrations and wanted to do something more personal
and practical," said Heselton, a staunch opponent of U.S. support for the
anti-Sandinista rebels. "The point is to somehow help the situation rather than
having those policies done in my name as a U.S. taxpayer."
</P>
<P>
Heselton is one of 350 volunteers from across the nation who have been
recruited and dispatched to Nicaragua's battle-scarred highlands since 1984 by
a Topanga-based organization, Architects and Planners in Support of Nicaragua.
These short-term brigadistas have built 85 homes, four schools and four water
systems.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Providing Equipment
</P>
<P>
APSNICA, as it is known, has also shipped $170,000 in trucks, generators,
chain-saw mills and other equipment to Nicaragua and taught campesinos to use
them. It has sent teachers, biochemists and transportation planners to the
Central American country for several months each to assist the government. It
has arranged trips for Americans to see the revolution firsthand. And, most
recently, it is helping rebuild a hurricane-ravaged village.
</P>
<P>
Its slogan defines its mission: "Help Build Not Destroy in Nicaragua."
</P>
<P>
The grass-roots, nonprofit project is run out of an architectural firm, set
deep within wooded Topanga Canyon, that specializes in helping the poor and
handicapped. APSNICA is one of a handful of groups nationwide -- and the
largest in Southern California -- that recruits Americans to support a
Sandinista revolution that the Reagan Administration has actively opposed for
the past 8 years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Challenging Policy
</P>
<P>
"Our idea always was that we should bring people down in different capacities
so that they can see what was happening there, work with the Nicaraguans, help
them, but also come back here and tell others what they've seen so we can
change the policy of the Administration," said Stephen Kerpen, 52, the Topanga
architect who founded and directs APSNICA.
</P>
<P>
"It's a policy, sad to say, that doesn't respect the sovereignty of Nicaragua,
that's contemptuous of Third World people. And it's a policy that kills men,
women and children."
</P>
<P>
APSNICA's educational program -- which includes individual slide shows, house
parties and a quarterly newsletter -- has reached more than 15,000 individuals
in the United States, Kerpen said. Volunteers have also made presentations to
civic groups, including several local Rotary clubs.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, groups such as the Quixote Center in Mount Rainier, Md.; Witness
for Peace in Washington, and TecNica in Berkeley have raised $202 million in
labor and supplies for Nicaragua since June, 1985, according to Sister Maureen
Fiedler, co-director of the Quixote Center. In addition, she said 1,500
Americans are working in Nicaragua at any given time.
</P>
<P>
These efforts seek to counteract U.S. military and humanitarian support for the
Contras. In fact, Fiedler said, annual fund-raising goals have been based on
the amount of U.S. Contra aid.
</P>
<P>
APSNICA's recruits represent a cross-section of men and women from 15 states.
Their ranks have included a cabinetmaker, computer programmer, factory worker,
lawyer, park ranger, electrician, waitress, mechanical engineer, university
lecturer and music teacher.
</P>
<P>
Some enlist because they want to see firsthand what's happening in Nicaragua,
Kerpen said. Others are drawn to a revolution that they say epitomizes a sense
of community and idealism that is missing in the United States. Many are driven
by opposition to the Administration's Central American policy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Selective Service Age
</P>
<P>
Heselton, who lives 12 miles from President-elect George Bush's family estate,
has another, more personal, incentive to see the Central American hostilities
end: His 19-year-old son recently registered with the Selective Service.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to see him killing Nicaraguans, and I don't want to see him in a
war down there," he said. "I don't see anything going on in Central America
that's worth Americans dying for."
</P>
<P>
Everyone pays his or her way down, room and board, a $300 administrative fee
and insurance costs as well as foregoing potential earnings at home. APSNICA
bluntly advises prospective recruits that they are putting themselves "in an
inherently risky situation."
</P>
<P>
Participants find various ways to take the time off. Some are self-employed.
Those who work in construction may go during the winter lull. Some teachers use
their summer vacations. Others take a leave of absence or go between jobs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department does not have an official policy opposing such groups
as APSNICA as long as they comply with U.S. law, said press officer Anita
Stockman. Kerpen, however, maintains that APSNICA has been harassed by the
government while shipping supplies. And some U.S. elected officials are
critical of those who seek to bolster the Managua government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sandinistas Criticized
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to object to people building shelter for the citizens of Nicaragua,
who are certainly among the oppressed of the earth," said Rep. Henry Hyde
(R-Ill.), a high-profile Contra supporter. "I do object to strengthening the
Sandinista government because I think it's a tyranny."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sandinistas -- who work closely with APSNICA -- welcome the
volunteers with open arms.
</P>
<P>
"They've been doing a wonderful job there," said Rita Clark, who is assistant
to Nicaragua's charge d'affaires in Washington and has visited APSNICA
projects. "These are people who saw a need and they started helping. The more
they do, the more they want to do."
</P>
<P>
Larry Weiss, 41, a Minneapolis carpenter and self-described anti-imperialist,
first went to Nicaragua with APSNICA in early 1987. He returned for almost 8
months later in the year as a project coordinator with his wife and two
daughters. He's going back for 6 weeks in March.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Won't Give Up'
</P>
<P>
Weiss said he was most impressed by the pride and determination of the
Nicaraguan peasants. For example, he recalled sitting around a campfire one
evening when two older couples discussed the hardships they endured under Gen.
Anastasio Somoza, the former U.S.-backed Nicaraguan president who was ousted by
the revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
"One guy said, 'We'll die before we'll go back to that. We're campesinos. We
know hunger. We can do that again. But we won't give up what we have for
anything.' "
</P>
<P>
Two events in the past 2 years have spurred APSNICA to expand its activities.
The most recent was Hurricane Joan, which killed more than 116 Nicaraguans in
October and further wracked an economy already crippled by war.
</P>
<P>
In response, APSNICA established a wood-milling operation in Pearl Lagoon on
the Caribbean coast 25 miles north of Bluefields, a town of 42,000 that was
largely destroyed. Volunteers are harvesting hurricane-felled trees on the
river bank and floating them downriver to the mill, where they will be used to
rebuild homes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Activist's Death
</P>
<P>
The other occurrence was the death of Benjamin E. Linder, 27, a mechanical
engineer from Portland, Ore., who suffered a fatal head wound in 1987 when his
armed work crew was ambushed by rebels in the northern Nicaragua war zone.
Linder was working on a hydroelectric project under the auspices of the
Nicaragua Appropriate Technology Project, which he had helped found.
</P>
<P>
"We felt strongly that he was targeted because he was a real figure down
there," Kerpen said as he sat at his desk beneath a poster of Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega. "And we felt it was a means for this Administration to
stop other Americans from building in Nicaragua. So instead of stopping us, we
made plans to build twice as much."
</P>
<P>
Unlike Linder, who was reportedly carrying a Kalashnikov assault rifle for
protection, APSNICA volunteers do not bear arms. Instead, they put themselves
in the hands of the cooperative defense committees. There have been no APSNICA
casualties.
</P>
<P>
The construction efforts are around the town of Mantiguas in the Matagalpa
region of north-central Nicaragua, which Kerpen describes as "a war zone but
not what you might call a combat zone." Volunteers have heard mortar fire but
never been in imminent danger, he said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grieving Mother
</P>
<P>
They have encountered grieving Nicaraguans, however. When an APSNICA-sponsored
delegation visited a cooperative that had been attacked by Contras, a woman
took the group to the grave site of her 16-year-old son who had been killed 5
days earlier, Kerpen recalled.
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'If any of you have cameras, take pictures of all the kids because I
don't even have a photograph of my son.' "
</P>
<P>
Still, the volunteers face many hardships. Health problems are endemic. APSNICA
warns participants prior to departure that typhoid fever is "not uncommon";
hepatitis is "very common"; malaria is "quite common"; worms, amoebas and other
diarrhea-causing parasites are "almost inevitable," and "many Nicaraguan dogs
have rabies."
</P>
<P>
Living conditions are primitive. The weather is hot and humid. Food is simple.
The workweek entails 45 hours of hard physical labor. Volunteers wash their
clothes by hand in the river.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Self-Sufficient
</P>
<P>
"I realized how simple the life is there, how people have learned to live on
the basis of their ability to devise tools and hard work," said Lisa Aarli, 29,
a Chicago tenant organizer who spent 2 months in Nicaragua in early 1988. "It
was one of the most intensive experiences of my life."
</P>
<P>
The experience of working in Nicaragua generally reinforces pre-existing
support for the revolution or creates new-found sympathy, Kerpen said.
Volunteers Heselton, Weiss and Aarli said this was the case for them.
</P>
<P>
Still, Aarli said: "We were very isolated. We were staying on this cooperative.
We didn't get out to see other things. In some ways, I didn't see much in a
bigger, broader sense."
</P>
<P>
It was the bigger geopolitical picture that Kerpen says drew him to Nicaragua
as a cause. A native New Yorker, he began his architectural activism nearly 25
years ago with urban renewal efforts in Harlem and continued them when he moved
to California in the late '60s and directed the Rural Development Corp., which
built federally subsidized housing in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unpaid Post
</P>
<P>
In 1971, he established a private architectural firm specializing in low-income
housing and barrier-free designs for the disabled with his partner, David
Marshall. Peoples Center for Housing Change now provides the headquarters and
corporate umbrella for APSNICA; Kerpen is the unsalaried, full-time director,
while Marshall handles Peoples Center's paying clients.
</P>
<P>
Kerpen and two others founded APSNICA after a trip to Nicaragua in 1984. The
idea arose when a Sandinista official asked them to raise money in the United
States for housing in Nicaragua. The first brigade was dispatched in December,
1985, to build 25 simple 3-room, brick-and-stone houses, a 1,200-square-foot
school and a water system.
</P>
<P>
"Some people will ask us, 'Well, aren't there communists down there?' " Kerpen
said. "The fact is that every country has a right to decide what kind of a
government they have. . . . Of course, if anything, it's a nationalist
government down there and nothing else. But the question itself is
impertinent."

ECONOMISTS SPLIT ON WHERE U.S. IS HEADED;
</P>
<P>
PANEL AGREES DEFICIT IS KEY ISSUE BUT DIVIDES ON CHANCE OF RECESSION
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, Times Staff Writer

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times' panel of distinguished economists reached a standoff
this year, equally divided over whether 1989 will be the year that a recession
finally halts America's longest postwar boom.
</P>
<P>
But the six members of The Times' Board of Economists who participated in the
year-end survey more or less agreed that three key issues will determine 1989's
economic fate. These are whether the Bush Administration and Congress will
agree on meaningful steps to lower the budget deficit; the reactions of foreign
investors, especially the Japanese, to economic developments here, and whether
American consumers, loaded down with record levels of debt, will nevertheless
continue to spend beyond their means.
</P>
<P>
As always, the Federal Reserve Board's role in setting interest rates, largely
in response to these issues, also is considered crucial.
</P>
<P>
The economists' forecasts differ so widely mainly because they hinge on
predictions of human behavior and the outcome of political maneuvering in
Washington, rather than simple number-crunching.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Six Participants
</P>
<P>
The bright note this year is that the board of economists as a group is
somewhat less pessimistic now than a year ago. Jarred by the October, 1987,
stock market crash, five out of eight board members last year predicted
recession in 1988. But the American economy romped right past the crash,
growing by at least 2.6% last year.
</P>
<P>
Only six economists participated this year because two have been enlisted in
the service of the Bush Administration. Michael A. Boskin resigned from the
board because he was named chairman of the President's Council of Economic
Advisers. Board member Allan H. Meltzer, a professor of political economy and
public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, declined to participate because he
is now serving as an adviser to the President's council.
</P>
<P>
The three who predict no recession in 1989 are George L. Perry, a senior fellow
at the Brookings Institution in Washington; Paul R. Krugman, a professor of
economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Irwin L. Kellner,
chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover in New York.
</P>
<P>
But those who predict that the expansion will come to an end in what is now its
seventh year are Robert Lekachman, professor of economics at Lehman College of
the City University of New York and author of "Visions and Nightmares: America
After Reagan"; David M. Gordon, economics professor at the New School for
Social Research in New York, and A. Gary Shilling, a New York-based economic
consultant and author of "The World Has Definitely Changed."
</P>
<P>
While the budget deficit has been a big concern in past years, this year the
economists agree that it is a pivotal question for the U.S. economy in 1989.
One reason is that the budget deficit, and the related U.S. trade deficit, have
become key determinants for how foreign investors and foreign central bankers
react, driving the dollar down or up, and making foreign capital for investment
here plentiful or scarce.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recession Scenario
</P>
<P>
The two economists who believe that Congress and the new President will be able
to agree promptly on budgetary steps serious enough to impress the jittery
world markets predicted that the economic expansion will continue at least one
more year, although the economy will probably grow at a slower rate. One,
Krugman, predicted no recession even though he doubts that there will be much
progress on the deficit this year.
</P>
<P>
But the rest, who don't expect agreement this year on spending cuts or a
combination of spending cuts and tax increases predicted a recession.
</P>
<P>
The recession scenario generally goes like this: A marked failure to do
something about the deficit could cause the dollar to drop dramatically against
major foreign currencies such as the yen and the West German mark as foreign
investors conclude that the U.S. economy isn't such a good investment and
foreign central bankers decide that there is no longer any point to propping up
the dollar. The Fed responds by sharply raising interest rates to attract back
foreign investors (higher interest rates on investments help compensate
investors for a depreciating dollar) and to choke off inflation that may be
caused by more expensive imports.
</P>
<P>
But a big hike in interest rates could easily end the expansion and would be
particularly dangerous at a time when both individuals and companies are loaded
up with record levels of debt.
</P>
<P>
Making the situation even more fragile, says Shilling, is that record amounts
of both personal and company debt are now subject to fluctuating, variable-rate
interest payments. This includes variable-rate mortgages, home equity loans and
credit card accounts for individuals, as well as variable-rate borrowing by
companies. As a result, Shilling says, any big hike in interest rates would be
felt almost immediately throughout the economy, triggering bankruptcies and an
abrupt drop-off of consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
Shilling foresees a recession starting in the first half of 1989, setoff in
part by the Fed raising interest rates to choke off a perceived threat of
renewed inflation and to make up for an expected loss of confidence in the
American economy by foreign investors. "It will be a classic case of the Fed
being forced to raise short-term interest rates to recession-precipitating
levels," he says.
</P>
<P>
Shilling also sees the first strong signs in some time of fear by industry that
inflation, currently at a relatively low rate of 4.5% annually as measured by
the consumer price index, is about to take off. Companies, he says, are doing
the first hedge-buying of inventory -- stocking up on supplies in expectation
that prices are about to go up -- since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Lekachman, another predictor of recession, owns up to having forecast a
downturn every year for the past four years. But he maintains that "the chances
are about 2 to 1 that by the fourth quarter of 1989, we'll see the recession."
He predicts that the main cause will be Japanese investors and Japan's central
bank, responding to what they view as a weak U.S. President and a political
"mess" in Washington's approach to the deficit. Lekachman notes that the United
States depends on a massive influx of foreign capital and says he detects signs
that the Japanese are increasingly willing to throw their weight around on the
global economic scene.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reprieve Predicted
</P>
<P>
If the Japanese lose confidence in Bush's ability to reduce the deficit, they
may well reduce their buying at U.S. Treasury auctions, which in turn could
sharply push up U.S. interest rates. "This will be the classic trigger for a
recession," he says.
</P>
<P>
Gordon foresees a particularly deep recession. "It's going to be pretty nasty
because of the mountainous levels of personal and corporate debt," he says.
</P>
<P>
But Kellner, a member of The Times' board who last year predicted a recession,
this year thinks the economy will squeak by with another reprieve. Kellner
thinks that despite the political problems, the Bush Administration will win an
agreement this year with legislators on a plan to eliminate the deficit over
four years. This, he maintains, would be enough to satisfy foreign investors
and Japanese and European governments and allow the Fed to ease up on its
current tight-money policy.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Kellner predicts a slackening of consumer spending sufficient to
keep inflation in check but not severe enough to induce a recession. Of the six
economists, Kellner alone expects consumer spending to slow significantly
without a sharp jolt of higher interest rates first.
</P>
<P>
Economic forecasters consider consumer spending extremely important to their
calculations since it makes up about two-thirds of the nation's economic
activity. (Slightly under half of this goes for items bought in stores, the
rest goes for rent, health care, transportation and other services.)
</P>
<P>
Kellner believes that consumers are getting exhausted from years of increased
spending and are about to cut back. With employment high, he says, "There is no
pent-up demand for big ticket items people delayed buying because they were out
of work."
</P>
<P>
He also notes that prices of expensive consumer items have risen faster than
most peoples' incomes. "Given that the cost of big-ticket items has gone up
faster than incomes, people have bought about all they're going to buy," he
asserts. As evidence, he cites the fact that consumer spending, adjusted for
inflation, was lower this fall than it was two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
The rest of The Times panel, however, doubts that consumers are likely to begin
acting so rationally. Some say that during the past eight years, encouraged by
the economic boom and the Republican Administration's supply side economics,
the habit of spending much and saving little has become ingrained. "Ronald
Reagan . . . really has gone a long distance to reinforce the American attitude
of spend today, pay tomorrow," says Lekachman.
</P>
<P>
Shilling, too, sees no signs of consumer spending slowing down. He notes that
the stock market crash didn't shock consumers into spending less. "The consumer
just isn't giving up," he said. "People are way overextended. They're borrowing
to pay their bills. People don't want to give up on the American dream of
ever-increasing purchasing power."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Economy Pretty Healthy'
</P>
<P>
Early indications that 1988 Christmas buying was relatively strong seem to give
credit to those who see no falloff of consumer spending. One fear is that
continued strong consumer demand will add to inflationary pressures, forcing
the Fed to continue raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
But Perry, although he foresees little change in consumer spending levels this
year, says he isn't particularly worried. "I think the economy is pretty
healthy," he states, adding that he thinks a recession in 1989 is unlikely.
"People have predicted it every year, and every year they've been wrong," he
says.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the economy is slowing a bit and that the gross national
product -- a measure of all goods and services produced in the economy -- will
continue to grow at an acceptably low rate of about 3% in 1989. Perry doubts
that foreigners will become so concerned about the U.S. economic situation that
they will begin dumping dollars. And he said that any substantial improvement
in the budget deficit would be met by a decline in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
He gives the Fed credit for keeping growth rates and inflation in check. "The
Fed is doing what it traditionally has done, to lean against the wind," Perry
says. "It sees an expansion that is still pretty vigorous, and it's letting
interest rates rise to take a little steam out."
</P>
<P>
Krugman, while not completely ruling out the possibility of recession in 1989,
sees a greater risk of an overheating economy. "The fundamentals are that we
still have very strong domestic demand and a weak dollar," he says. He believes
that the Fed will continue to nudge up interest rates, even enough to send some
highly leveraged companies into bankruptcy. But because demand is so strong, he
doesn't predict a full-fledged recession. Because with the wave of corporate
takeovers and leveraged buyouts companies are heavily indebted, "what we have
is a strange economy -- you could have a lot of bankrupt companies working at
(full) capacity."

BUSINESS GROUPS CALL DEFICIT REDUCTION MOST CRITICAL TASK
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For organizations representing business in Washington, the transition from
President Reagan to President Bush is a change from very good to even better.
</P>
<P>
Business almost always found itself on Reagan's side. His campaigns to cut tax
rates and reduce burdensome federal regulations could have been written in
corporate board rooms.
</P>
<P>
But Reagan's Administration was a tumultuous one. He vetoed 78 pieces of
legislation in his eight years, and Congress managed to override him nine
times.
</P>
<P>
Now representatives of business organizations are looking forward with pleasure
to a kinder, gentler era. George Bush, while no less business oriented than
Reagan, is a two-term veteran of the House of Representatives; of the 13
Cabinet members he has selected so far, two are former senators and three are
former House members.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders predict that Bush will try to establish a more cooperative
relationship with the Democratic-controlled House and Senate. And that, they
hope, will prove more productive -- especially on the all-important issue of
reducing the federal deficit -- than Reagan's more confrontational style.
</P>
<P>
"Bush is a consummate Washington insider," said Joseph P. O'Neil, president of
the American Retail Federation. "He's more inclined to seek accommodations than
President Reagan was. On that score, a lot of issues left on the table are
likely to get settled."
</P>
<P>
For example, several business lobbyists suggested, Bush might propose a
compromise minimum wage increase, lower than the $4.55 an hour unsuccessfully
sought by the Democrats. That way, Bush could get credit for helping the
working poor without offending business groups.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Bush proposals on parental leave and child care would force Congress
to address those issues on his terms and impose less of a burden on business
than Democratic alternatives that were talked to death in the Senate last fall.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prefer Spending Cuts
</P>
<P>
Business has no particular legislative wish list of its own. At one time it
might have hoped that Bush would follow through on a campaign promise and
propose a tax break for capital gains. But now it understands that Bush does
not dare propose tinkering with the tax code for fear that Congress would take
the opportunity to legislate tax increases as well as reductions.
</P>
<P>
"Business agenda?" asked Stacy Mobley, vice president for federal relations of
Du Pont Co. "We're always reacting. This coming year, like all other years,
we're going to be reacting." Business' fondest hope is that Bush and Congress
will join forces to reduce the federal deficit. Business organizations regard
spending cuts as the best approach, although some of them would even tolerate a
tax increase.
</P>
<P>
Sara Ross, assistant vice president for communications of the National Assn. of
Manufacturers, said NAM hoped that Bush would follow the lead of the National
Economic Commission, a congressionally mandated blue-ribbon panel that is to
recommend budget-cutting measures next year.
</P>
<P>
"We favor spending cuts," Ross said, "and then a consumption tax increase as a
last resort."
</P>
<P>
O'Neil, of the American Retail Federation, agreed that the budget was the most
critical issue facing the nation and said a lot of Washington insiders expected
a tax increase next year.
</P>
<P>
"Retailers are against consumption taxes," he said, "but a lot of business
firms would support a gasoline tax increase as a way to cut the deficit if the
money is earmarked for that purpose."
</P>
<P>
Mobley also rated deficit reduction as Bush's leading problem. "Everything
hinges on that," Mobley said. "At least a combination of spending cuts and new
revenues are needed. Bush is going to have to play an active role. I don't
foresee any stalemate or legislative gridlock."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Veto Less Likely
</P>
<P>
As for a gasoline tax increase, he added: "We're not pushing it, but if you had
to look at additional revenues, it's broad-based, doesn't adversely affect
energy-intensive industries and is probably the lesser of all the evils."
</P>
<P>
But most business representatives take a hard line against any kind of tax
increase. "If Bush agrees to a tax increase as the Democrats want him to do,
he's a one-term President," said John J. Motley, legislative director for the
National Federation of Independent Business, which represents small retail and
service firms with an average of eight employees and $500,000 in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
And Stephen Moore, a budget analyst for the business-backed Heritage
Foundation, said Bush should be willing to accept the automatic, indiscriminate
spending cuts of the Gramm-Rudman law rather than raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
On overall relations with Congress, there was a consensus that Bush would be
far less likely to resort to the veto and more likely to make deals with the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
"Bush is a product of Washington," Du Pont's Mobley said. "He didn't run
against Washington. My feeling is that he will be able to work with Congress
better than Reagan or Jimmy Carter. I think he will seek accommodation."
</P>
<P>
Al Bourland, a veteran of 20 years of lobbying for the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, agreed.
</P>
<P>
"He (Bush) is going to put out the olive branch more than Reagan did," Bourland
said. "I think you'll have less of a philosophical approach -- he's more
inclined to a political, pragmatic solution."
</P>
<P>
But Bourland added that the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate could
challenge Bush on the theory that he is less popular than Reagan and thus less
likely to be able to appeal to the public over the heads of the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
In the past, he said, business groups could rely on a Reagan veto or the threat
of a Reagan veto to influence major legislation as it went through the House
and Senate. "It was one of the biggest arrows in our quiver," Bourland
recalled.
</P>
<P>
Others, however, think that Bush could undercut his -- and business's --
political opponents by going on the offensive on such controversial issues as
raising the federal minimum wage, unchanged since 1981 at $3.35 an hour.
</P>
<P>
Senate Democrats brought up a bill this year to raise that figure to $4.55 an
hour, but Republicans filibustered it to death -- even though Bush said in a
campaign statement that he favored some unspecified increase.
</P>
<P>
Lobbyist Motley said Bush could propose a $4.25 hourly rate, together with a
lower figure for young people, and probably get near-unanimous Republican
support and enough Democrats to assure the bill's enactment.
</P>
<P>
"I think you may see this Administration go on the offensive with initiatives
of their own in two or three areas," Motley said.
</P>
<P>
The same technique, business lobbyists agreed, could be employed on other
social legislation to get bipartisan backing for Bush initiatives on child
care, unpaid leave for new parents and health insurance for workers not covered
by company plans.
</P>
<P>
And on environmental issues, business expects renewed action now that Senate
Democrats have selected George J. Mitchell of Maine as their new leader and
Bush has named William K. Reilly, president of the World Wildlife Fund, as head
of the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
In particular, Congress is likely to try to amend the Clean Air Act, a pet
issue of Mitchell's. But business groups are confident that Mitchell will have
to make concessions to their concerns over additional costs if he wants to get
the legislation through Congress.
</P>
<P>
On their major stand against new federal benefits, the business groups expect
Bush to be on their side, with his veto pen ready if necessary. But there is a
yearning for a more ecumenical style.
</P>
<P>
"Bush is a very pro-business President, and we're grateful for that," said the
NAM's Ross. "But problems are coming to a head, with a lot of unfinished
business. We need a consensus approach."

INVESTING IN 1989;
</P>
<P>
PLAYING IT SAFE COULD BE WRONG STRATEGY;
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE, SHORT-TERM BONDS LOOK GOOD BUT ART MARKET MAY COOL
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Investors played it safe in 1988. But they would have been better off had they
not. And being overly cautious this year also could be a mistake, many
investment advisers say.
</P>
<P>
Aided by takeovers, strong corporate earnings and other factors, stocks defied
a mass exodus by individual investors to post double-digit gains last year. As
the table accompanying this story shows, equities and equity mutual funds
easily beat bonds, savings and most other conservative investments that small
investors generally preferred amid lingering memories of the October, 1987,
stock crash.
</P>
<P>
But bonds -- led by the high-yield "junk" sector -- did well during the year,
despite rising interest rates toward year-end that pushed prices down and
partially offset gains in yields.
</P>
<P>
Collectibles posted a mixed year, with art topping all major investments in
1988 with a whopping 41.99% gain through November, and rare investment-grade
coins finishing second. But stamp prices took a licking, rising just barely.
The biggest losers: gold and silver, hit by abundant supplies and subdued fears
of higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
Will these trends continue in 1989? Not surprisingly, experts can't agree on
the overall direction for stocks and bonds. But on some things there is general
agreement:
</P>
<P>
* Buyers of short-term bonds and money market funds will continue to enjoy
among the best yields in years, at least into the early part of the year.
</P>
<P>
* Although the Dow Jones industrial index closed 1988 near a post-crash high,
plenty of individual stocks are depressed and have room to go much higher.
</P>
<P>
* Some housing markets, such as those in California, will continue to be hot,
while others, such as in oil-depressed areas and the Northeast, will remain in
slumps.
</P>
<P>
* Gold and silver are likely to remain dull, but platinum has a brighter
outlook.
</P>
<P>
* Blistering prices in the art market are due for a correction.
</P>
<P>
Whether these predictions come true, of course, depends a lot on what happens
to interest rates and the economy. Economists generally predict that interest
rates will continue rising into the first part of the year, declining in the
second half as economic growth slows. A recession may be a threat in late 1989
and early 1990, economists say, but they have been crying wolf about a downturn
for months now -- and the economy fortunately has not obliged.
</P>
<P>
A recession "will happen eventually, but when is still too early too tell,"
says David A. Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources, reflecting the
gun-shy attitude of many forecasters who have made it a habit of prematurely
predicting recessions.
</P>
<P>
Here is a review of opinions on some key segments for small investors:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bonds and savings
</P>
<P>
Bonds had a good year generally, as "junk bonds," municipals and long-term
investment-grade corporates posted double-digit total returns (including price
appreciation and yield).
</P>
<P>
Savers are enjoying among the highest yields in short-term investments in
years, thanks to the Fed's tight-money policies. Yields on three-month Treasury
bills, for example, recently hit 8.22%, the highest in 3 1/2 years. Recent
9%-plus yields on two-year Treasuries have topped those on 30-year issues.
</P>
<P>
Money market funds also look great, yielding an average of 8.52%, more than two
percentage points better than the 6.20% average yields for bank money market
deposit accounts. The spread normally is less than 1 point, but now is higher
because money market funds generally move up faster in a rising interest rate
environment, says Susan M. Cook, editor of Donoghue's Money Fund Report.
</P>
<P>
Analysts generally expect short-term rates to continue rising well into the
first half of this year. But toward mid-year, they say, interest rates should
begin to decline, making money market funds and short-term Treasuries somewhat
less attractive.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, some advisers say, investors should consider buying long-term
Treasury issues. Even though they yield less than short-term issues now, they
are a good way to lock in high yields, and they will gain in value once
interest rates fall.
</P>
<P>
For conservative investors who stick only to safe, federally insured bank
certificates of deposit, the outlook is both good and bad. Banks will continue
to be slow in boosting CD rates to keep up with rises in the prime rate and
other market interest rates, says Robert K. Heady, publisher of Bank Rate
Monitor.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason to believe that banks in '89 will suddenly get religion to
help the consumer," Heady says.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, those who shop for the highest-yielding CDs nationwide are
finding that troubled institutions no longer dominate the list of firms with
highest savings rates.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the percentage of troubled Texas thrifts on the lists of
institutions with top-yielding CDs has plummeted from 75% to 13%, Heady says.
They have been replaced by much-stronger Northeastern institutions, who are
boosting rates to attract deposit money that can then be loaned out to fuel
that region's bustling economy. That trend should continue this year, Heady
says.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stocks
</P>
<P>
Surprising many experts, stocks had a good year last year, with Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-stock index gaining 16.61% with dividends reinvested. The Dow Jones
industrial index closed at 2,168.57, close to its post-crash high of 2183.50.
</P>
<P>
But there is no consensus that the good times will continue rolling.
</P>
<P>
Even normally bullish brokerage houses disagree. Dean Witter, for example,
leads the bulls in suggesting that investors put 71% of their assets into
stocks, versus 25% in bonds and only 4% in cash equivalents. But over at Paine
Webber, bearish analysts advise only 14% in equities, versus 35% in bonds and a
whopping 51% in cash equivalents.
</P>
<P>
Clearly, experts are looking at much of the same data but are coming to
different conclusions. The bulls see low price-earnings ratios (stock prices
divided by earnings per share) on the S&amp;P 500 of about 12, down from above
20 before the crash and more than 15 after the crash. They also cite strong
gains in corporate profits and cash flow, and predictions that takeovers will
continue at 1988's hot pace.
</P>
<P>
The bulls also point to the high degree of pessimism among investment advisers.
Such bearishness is actually bullish, they say, because it means that a lot of
selling has already occurred. "A lot of people have a lot of cash, and that's a
mistake," says John D. Connolly, chairman of the investment policy committee at
Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
But the bears counter that there is still a lot more cash that could hit the
sidelines before stocks are ready to take off again. High yields on Treasury
securities and other fixed-income investments are siphoning off money that
otherwise would go to stocks. Recent rallies have occured with low trading
volume and relatively few stocks setting new 52-week highs, they say. And the
threat of recession and slower economic growth bodes poorly for equities.
</P>
<P>
Weighing all arguments, some experts are straddling the fence. The Dow, they
say, will continue to trade in a narrow range between 1,900 and 2,200.
</P>
<P>
"Until there is some direction from the new Bush Administration on fundamental
economic issues, such as the budget deficit . . . the market is going to
continue to trade in a narrow range," says Joseph Hardiman, president of the
National Assn. of Securities Dealers. "Once we see how these issues are
resolved, you'll see a (clearer) direction for the market, whether up or down."
</P>
<P>
The key to investing, many experts say, will be in picking the right stocks
that will perform well regardless of the overall market's direction. Shying
away from the market completely -- as many investors have done -- could result
in many missed opportunities, they say.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Real Estate
</P>
<P>
The outlook for home prices will continue to be mixed, with some markets
remaining hot while others will stay behind, says John A. Tuccillo, chief
economist for the National Assn. of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
In California, home prices will continue to post strong gains, although slower
economic growth will dampen price hikes somewhat, he says.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the influx of new residents, a strong economy and restrictions in new
housing due to slow-growth measures, California boasted five of the 10 markets
nationwide with the most price appreciation in 1988. Those five -- Orange
County, San Diego, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area and San Fernando
Valley -- each posted gains of more than 15%, Tuccillo says.
</P>
<P>
The Midwest also will show strong increases, but the Northeast and Oil Patch
states will remain sluggish, Tuccillo says.
</P>
<P>
As for office buildings and other commercial real estate, many markets remain
soft due to overbuilding, slow economies and loss of tax breaks under tax
reform. Accordingly, yields on many limited partnerships and real estate
investment trusts have been declining. Investors must be careful, because with
fewer tax breaks, real estate investments will have to make it largely on their
economics.
</P>
<P>
"You don't have the tax factor working for you, so there is nothing to bail you
out if you make a mistake," Tuccillo says.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Precious Metals
</P>
<P>
Gold and silver were among the top performers in 1987, but they flopped last
year. And this year promises not to be much better, many experts say.
</P>
<P>
Both gold and silver face plentiful supplies and only modest increases in
demand. And inflation is expected to increase only modestly, dampening buying
of metals for their traditional roles as inflation hedges.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, industrial demand for platinum is expected to rise, despite
a recent announcement by Ford Motor that it had developed a platinum substitute
in catalytic converters, which account for one third of worldwide demand.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Collectibles
</P>
<P>
In fine art, caution is the word for 1989. Prices continued to rise to dizzying
heights last year, confounding many experts. Sotheby's, the big auction house,
reported record or new record prices in Impressionist and Contemporary art, but
strong rises even hit lower price categories. If history is any guide, this
boom can't last forever, experts say.
</P>
<P>
Stamps, however, posted a modest year, but observers are encouraged by recent
pickups in prices at auctions, says Elaine R. Boughner, managing editor of
Linn's Stamp News.
</P>
<P>
Many types of collector coins also gained only modestly. But rare, top
investment-grade coins posted double-digit gains, as investors were encouraged
by improved grading standards, says Keith M. Zaner, editor of Coin World
Trends. More investors are expected to enter the market this year through new
mutual funds or limited partnerships, Zaner says.
</P>
<P>
The hottest collector market? Consider baseball cards. Prices of rare,
mint-condition cards of such former greats as Mickey Mantle have increased more
than five-fold in recent years.

What are the best investments for 1989?
</P>
<P>
To answer that question, The Times asked five investment experts to decide how
they would invest $10,000, in both conservative and risky portfolios. For the
conservative portfolio, the experts assumed that $10,000 was all they had to
invest, and thus they couldn't afford to lose any of it. For the risky
portfolio, the experts assumed that $10,000 was part of a total $100,000
portfolio, and thus they could afford to take capital losses.
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the experts disagreed on the outlook for the stock market.
But they all agreed that staying away from the market entirely would be a
mistake because there are plenty of individual stocks or stock mutual funds
that should do well, even if the market as a whole heads down.
</P>
<P>
Here are their picks:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DONALD J. PHILLIPS
</P>
<P>
Phillips is editor of Mutual Fund Values, a Chicago investment advisory service
that evaluates performance, risk, expenses and other key measures for 1,082
mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
Outlook: With so much money on the sidelines, stocks and stock mutual funds
should do well again in 1989, he says.
</P>
<P>
Conservative $10,000: Phillips slips $5,000 into Vanguard Short-Term Bond Fund,
a no-load (no sales charge) mutual fund that invests in fixed-income securities
with slightly longer maturities than those in money market funds. But the fund
could return as much as 2 to 3 percentage points more than money funds, with
virtually no risk of loss of principal, he says. It has posted average
compounded annual returns of 10.41% in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Phillips pops another $3,000 into T. Rowe Price New Income, a no-load fund with
bonds of even longer maturities than the Vanguard fund. It has earned average
compounded annual returns of 10.33% for the past 10 years. He tucks his last
$2,000 into Strong Investment Fund, which he describes as one of the more
conservative funds with exposure to stocks, which constitute up to 40% of its
portfolio. It boasts an average compounded annual return of 10.72% in the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
Risky $10,000: Phillips splits it equally into four stock funds. Two, Royce
Value Trust and Gabelli Equity Trust, are relatively new "closed-end" funds
whose shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange and are managed by
well-respected money gurus Charles Royce and Mario Gabelli, respectively. As
evidence of Royce's record, his older Pennsylvania Mutual fund has posted
average annualized compounded returns of 19.54% for the past 10 years. Gabelli
Asset Trust had gained 35.47% in the 12 months ended Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
Phillips favors two no-load mutual funds. One is Nicholas Limited Edition, a
2-year-old small-company stock fund managed by Albert Nicholas, whose older
Nicholas Fund has posted a compounded annual return of 20.23% over the past 10
years. The other is GIT Equity-Special Growth, another small-company fund that
has posted a compounded annual return of 14.9% over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GERALDINE WEISS
</P>
<P>
Weiss, editor and publisher of Investment Quality Trends, a La Jolla
newsletter, is a leading expert on dividend-oriented investing. Her
newsletter's recommendations were up 21.2% in 1988 through October, according
to Hulbert Financial Digest, a newsletter that tracks performances of other
newsletters.
</P>
<P>
Outlook: While the market as a whole has more room to fall than to gain, many
stocks are undervalued and have little downside risk. The key is to find stocks
whose dividend yields are at levels where their historical trading patterns
show they were near the bottom in price and thus undervalued.
</P>
<P>
Conservative $10,000: Weiss sticks to simplicity: She puts it all in insured
savings accounts or certificates of deposit. She likes to keep her CD
maturities staggered so that some cash is always coming available.
</P>
<P>
Risky $10,000: Weiss taps nine stocks. Her first choice, for $1,500, is
Bristol-Myers, a company that consistently raises dividends and is historically
undervalued with a dividend yield of about 4.5% (she considers 4% or more to be
levels at which it is undervalued). For another $1,500 she taps Xerox, which is
undergoing a turnaround, lowering costs and increasing profit margins. Its
yield of 5.5% makes it highly undervalued.
</P>
<P>
Weiss splits her remaining $7,000 equally among seven blue chip stocks that she
considers to be close to undervalued levels, based on dividend yields. They are
Schlumberger, Texas Utilities, Houston Industries, Baxter International,
International Business Machines, American Medical International and Eastman
Kodak.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JOHN W. ROGERS JR.
</P>
<P>
Rogers, at age 30, is a rising young star in mutual fund management. His
Calvert Ariel Growth, a small-company growth stock fund, was up 31.83% this
year through Dec. 9, among the year's top performers. That followed a 11.4%
rise in 1987, a strong gain in a year when the crash made losers of many stock
funds.
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Select stocks of quality companies that enjoy solid market shares in
stable, non-cyclical businesses, but that are also undervalued and followed by
few analysts.
</P>
<P>
Conservative $10,000: Rogers places $4,000 into money market funds. The rest
goes into two conservatively managed stock mutual funds with excellent
long-term reputations that he expects will continue to do well even in a down
market. "It's nice to have growth as part of your portfolio," even if it's your
first $10,000, he says.
</P>
<P>
Rogers puts $4,000 of the remainder in Acorn Fund, a no-load fund with domestic
and international stocks that has posted a compounded annual return of 18.78%
in the past 10 years. The other $2,000 goes into Evergreen Total Return, a
no-load stock and bond fund with a compounded annual return of 17.99% in the
past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Risky $10,000: Rogers divides his risky $10,000 evenly between seven stocks.
One of his favorites is Clorox, the bleach maker with a strong cash flow and
balance sheet. Its share price has been beaten down somewhat by analysts'
concerns that earnings will be negatively impacted by its planned rollout of a
new detergent -- concerns that Rogers finds overblown and shortsighted.
</P>
<P>
Rogers also likes McCormick &amp; Co., a spice concern flush with cash that
seems to be followed by few analysts. Next he selects two office products
stocks: United Stationers, the nation's largest distributor of office products,
and Sanford, known for its markers and pens.
</P>
<P>
He also picks two specialty packaging firms: Shorewood Packaging, the largest
packager of records, compact discs, cassette tapes and music videos, and
Sealright, the top ice cream packager. Finally, he taps SEI, a large pension
fund consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NOLA MADDOX FALCONE
</P>
<P>
Falcone is co-manager of Evergreen Total Return, a stock and bond mutual fund
that's among the top performers among so-called growth and income funds that
seek capital gains as well as dividend income.
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The stock market will be sluggish, but real undervalued stocks with
strong dividend yields will hold up well.
</P>
<P>
Conservative $10,000: Falcone puts $5,000 in two-year Treasury notes, currently
yielding about 9.11%, higher than 30-year Treasury bonds. She tucks the other
$5,000 into a money market fund.
</P>
<P>
Risky $10,000: Falcone puts it into three "depressed" stocks with good yields
that will limit downside risk. "I wouldn't mind putting my mother into these,"
she says. The first $4,500 goes into Bristol-Myers, a company misperceived by
investors who don't realize that it has turned into a high-growth drug company
with exciting new products in such fields as cancer treatment and orthopedics,
she says.
</P>
<P>
Falcone slips another $2,500 into First Fidelity Bancorp, whose stock was
pushed down following a recent announcement of a huge writeoff due to poor
loans. The negative reaction has been overdone, she says. As a extra bonus, the
stock yields about 7.7%.
</P>
<P>
Her last $3,000 goes to Springs Industries, a towel and comforter maker that
recently bought a company that makes industrial fabric used in electronic
circuit boards, aerospace construction and marine industries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JOHN D. CONNOLLY
</P>
<P>
Connolly is chairman of the investment policy committee at Dean Witter
Reynolds, currently among the most bullish of Wall Street investment firms.
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Stocks will do well largely because interest rates will begin to
decline in coming months. At that point, he says, investors will pull money out
of short-term fixed-income investments and put it into stocks.
</P>
<P>
Conservative $10,000: Connolly socks it simply into one-year CDs, which have a
better return than Treasury bills. "If you can't afford to lose, you can't
afford to play" with stocks and other higher-risk, higher-return investments,
he says.
</P>
<P>
Risky $10,000: Connolly divides it equally among five stocks that he considers
undervalued with price-earnings ratios (stock price divided by earnings per
share) far under what he thinks they should be.
</P>
<P>
The first, Price Co., is a retailer that he expects to enjoy 25% earnings
growth. Next he tabs Computer Associates, the nation's biggest independent
supplier of systems software.
</P>
<P>
Connolly also likes H. F. Ahmanson, a strong savings and loan firm that could
benefit from lower interest rates and a resolution of troubles plaguing the
S&amp;L federal deposit insurance system. His fourth pick is Schering-Plough, a
drug firm that he expects will post 20% annual earnings growth in the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
His final selection is Monsanto, a chemical and drug firm that has been hurt by
adverse rulings on an intrauterine device. It is selling far under the price
shareholders would get if the company was broken up, Connolly says.
